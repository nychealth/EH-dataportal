      <description>Healthy waterways are important for both aquatic life and humans who use the water for recreation.
We measure the quality of harbor water through two key indicators:
Dissolved oxygen is essential for most aquatic life. Coastal habitats and ecosystems thrive in environments with high concentrations of dissolved oxygen.
Concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria and Enterococci bacteria. Higher levels of these bacteria can mean there is sewage-related water pollution. Though most of these bacteria do not cause disease, higher concentrations can indicate the presence of pathogenic (disease-producing) bacteria.</description>

      <guid>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/healthy-eating/</guid>
      <description>Healthy eating is associated with better health, including a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. That means that having access to healthy, safe, and affordable food choices is crucial for a person to achieve healthy eating habits.
Food access is influenced by many environmental factors, including proximity to food retail outlets and neighborhood-level resources (like neighborhood poverty, and availability of public transportation).
Sugary drinks contribute to a higher-calorie diet, increased risk of heart disease and diabetes, and long-term weight gain.</description>

      <description>Physical activity and healthy eating are among the leading ways to get and stay healthy.
Active design is an applied, evidence-informed approach to improve physical, mental and social health outcomes through the design of the built environment.
To improve health, we can:
Increase access to public parks and recreation Create pedestrian plazas, and maintain sidewalks Plant street trees Provide safer cycling infrastructure and secure bicycle storage Make stairways attractive and accessible Strategies like these can have a measurable effect on people’s ability to safely maintain their physical, mental, and social health.</description>

      <description>Air quality is a measure of the condition of the air around us. The less air pollution there is, the better the air quality.
Like many cities, New York City&amp;rsquo;s air contains particles, liquid droplets, gases, and other contaminants that could impact health. Two pollutants, particulate matter and ground-level ozone, are of particular health concern.
Although New York City&amp;rsquo;s air does not currently meet federal air quality standards, it has improved significantly over the past two decades.</description>

      <description>Bed bugs are small insects that feed mainly on human blood. They are often confused with other insects, and many people are not even aware of their presence until they have been bitten. However, not everyone has a reaction to bed bug bites. You may not discover that you have bed bugs until you see other signs of the pests such as, bed bugs themselves, their eggs or droppings, or the blood stains they leave behind in mattresses, box springs, chairs or other materials.</description>

      <description>Note: We are no longer updating birth defects data on the EH Data Portal. For more recent data, visit the New York State Environmental Public Health Tracker.
Birth defects (also called congenital malformations) are conditions that happen when a baby does not develop normally during pregnancy. Structural defects may include missing limbs, malformed hearts, spina bifida and genetic conditions like Down Syndrome. Most birth defects happen during the first three months of pregnancy and are detected within the first year of life.</description>

      <guid>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/birth-outcomes/</guid>
      <description>Close to 125,000 live births occur in New York City (NYC) each year. Most babies are born healthy, but those born prematurely or with low birth weight are at greater risk of disability or death. This site tracks indicators of fetal growth and development, infant and perinatal mortality, fertility and sex ratio at birth.
Birth Outcomes and the Environment Because many genetic and lifestyle factors influence growth and development of fetuses and babies, it can be difficult for researchers to study the effects of environmental exposures on birth outcomes.</description>

      <description>Cancer begins when cells in a part of the body start to grow out of control. There are many kinds of cancer, but they all start because of out-of-control growth of abnormal cells. Leukemia (cancer of the blood-forming cells) is the most common form of childhood cancer. There are different kinds of childhood leukemia. The most common kinds are acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia . Brain and other nervous system cancers are the second most common types of childhood cancers.</description>

      <description>Smoking causes over a dozen cancers, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and many other diseases; it remains a leading cause of death in New York City (NYC). On average, people who do not smoke live about 10 years longer than people who do.
Additionally, there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke causes cancer, heart disease and other illnesses in adults. Children exposed to smoke are more likely to have bronchitis, asthma attacks, ear infections, pneumonia and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).</description>

      <description>All NYC residences receive drinking water from a public water system. Most water is gravity fed from a network of reservoirs and lakes in protected watersheds, up to 125 miles from the city.
The NYC water system consists of two surface water systems: Croton and Catskill/Delaware and one groundwater system, in Southwestern Queens. Since 1999, the Croton system has served as a supplemental water system. The Catskill/Delaware reservoir system supplies almost all NYC drinking water.</description>

      <guid>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/falls-among-older-adults/</guid>
      <description>Each year, one in three older adults (65 years and older) falls. Among New York City&amp;rsquo;s older adults, there are approximately 30,500 emergency department (ED) visits, 16,600 hospitalizations, and 300 deaths each year. Falls are not a normal part of aging, and research shows that many falls can be prevented.
Falls and the environment Although falls can occur anywhere, falls among older adults frequently happen at home. More than one-half of fall-related hospitalizations among older adults were due to falls in the home.</description>

      <description>Health care is a valuable tool to stay healthy.
Health insurance coverage is associated with many health benefits. People with health insurance are more likely to have a regular doctor, receive preventive care services, better manage chronic health conditions, have longer life expectancy, and more.
However, not all New Yorkers can access appropriate amounts of care. Many New Yorkers remain uninsured. People without access to appropriate health care don&amp;rsquo;t receive the care they need to stay healthy.</description>

      <description>Buildings with maintenance issues and disrepair can harm health. Across NYC, low-income neighborhoods have a higher percentage of buildings in disrepair due to past and present disinvestment and housing discrimination. This housing disrepair harms residents&amp;rsquo; health.
No family should have to choose between affordable and healthy housing. All tenants are entitled to safe, decent and sanitary housing, which prevents disease and injury. All building owners are required by law to provide essential services such as heat and hot water, make timely repairs, and maintain a pest-free building.</description>

      <description>Lead is a metal that is toxic to people. There is no safe level of lead in your body. It can cause learning and behavior problems, and delay physical growth and mental development.
In the past, it was used in gasoline, paint, ceramics, caulking, pipes and solder. In 1960, NYC banned the use of lead-based paint in homes. A national ban came into effect in 1978. Leaded gasoline was phased out beginning in the 1970&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Mental health is a person’s emotional, psychological, and social wellbeing. It is an important part of overall health.
Many factors can contribute to poor mental health. These include chronic disease, poverty, and poor environmental conditions. Many adults with mental illness do not receive the treatment they need.
Mental health and the environment A person’s environment affects their mental health.
Neighborhood factors like green space, noise, and infrastructure can affect mental health.</description>

      <description>Rats and mice are common, but preventable. In NYC, rats tend to be seen on streets and sidewalks, and in backyards and basements, while mice are almost always found inside homes.
Rats and mice thrive where there are sources of food and shelter and where property owners fail to prevent and adequately respond to their presence.
This site provides survey data on the prevalence of mice or rats inside and outside of buildings.</description>

      <description>Death is, of course, a severe health outcome. Many deaths are preventable.
Premature mortality lets us look at deaths before age 65. It can be a useful way to indicate the overall health of the population.
Neonatal deaths, postneonatal deaths, and infant deaths let us look at deaths among the the youngest members of our communities. Infants, with new, developing bodies, can be very susceptible to environmental threats - like poisonings, accidents, and injuries.</description>

      <description>People who are overweight or obese are at increased risk for heart disease and diabetes. Physical activity and healthy eating can promote well-being and relieve stress.
Weight and the Environment Neighborhood conditions and resources can encourage or discourage healthy behaviors. The density and types of food retail outlets available in neighborhoods may affect food shopping habits and nutrition choices of residents. Healthy food choices combined with physically active lifestyle support maintenance of an optimal bodyweight and overall good health.</description>

      <guid>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/pesticides/</guid>
      <description>Pesticides are chemicals applied to kill or control insects, rats and mice, undesirable plants and weeds, or fungi (e.g., mold). Pesticides are often categorized by type of use (e.g., rodenticide, insecticide) or chemical class (e.g., organophosphate, pyrethroid).
Modern pesticides have been developed to have less persistence in the environment than earlier chlorine-based chemicals such as DDT. Pesticides may be applied by a commercial applicator or a non-professional who has purchased a product from a store.</description>

      <guid>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/restaurant-food-safety/</guid>
      <description>New York City has approximately 24,000 restaurants that the Health Department inspects every year to monitor compliance with city and state food safety regulations. At the end of an inspection, the Health Department gives restaurants a score, which is eventually converted to a grade of A, B or C. This site describes the distribution of A grades across New York City restaurants.
Restaurant Food Safety and Health Safe food handling can protect diners from foodborne illness.</description>

      <description>Social and economic conditions affect people’s health. These conditions (also called “social determinants of health”) are conditions that people may be born into or fall into over the course of their lives.
People tend to be healthier when they have access to:
Economic and financial stability Higher education Adequate health care Healthy neighborhoods and safe, strong communities But when people don’t have access to these conditions, they experience worse health outcomes.</description>

      <title>Transportation-related injuries</title>
      <link>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/transportation-related-injuries/</link>

      <guid>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/transportation-related-injuries/</guid>
      <description>Traffic injuries are no accident. Like other public health concerns, they are preventable through data driven solutions. In NYC, traffic injuries, which include injuries among pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, and motor vehicle occupants, are a leading cause of injury-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits.
In February 2014, NYC launched “Vision Zero”, an action plan to reduce injuries and deaths on city streets. Vision Zero is a multi-agency effort, incorporating road engineering, traffic enforcement, community outreach and education, and policy work to make NYC streets safer.</description>

      <guid>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/vector-borne-disease/</guid>
      <description>Vectorborne diseases are diseases that are transmitted from an arthropod (usually a tick or mosquito, etc.) to humans or other animals. Some vectorborne disease agents are maintained primarily through transmission between arthropods and humans (e.g., dengue virus and malaria), while others are maintained between arthropods and animal reservoirs (e.g., Lyme disease and West Nile virus) and humans may become infected incidentally.
Vectorborne Disease and the Environment Climate is one of many important interacting variables that affect people’s risk for vectorborne diseases in New York City.</description>

      <guid>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/violence/</guid>
      <description>Violence is the use of physical, verbal, and/or emotional force to injure, harm, abuse, damage, or destroy. Interpersonal violence includes child abuse and neglect, youth violence, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and elder abuse. Violence can involve injury to self, including self-harm, suicide attempts, and death by suicide. Violence can also take the form of power against a group or community.
Violence is a public health issue because it is a cause of morbidity and mortality, leading to physical and emotional harm, an increase in negative health outcomes, premature death, psychological trauma and persistent fear to individuals and communities.</description>

      <description>People get around New York City in many ways - public transit, walking, cycling, driving, and other modes too. When these individual behaviors are added up, they shape our city and our health.
Our built environment influences these behaviors. The design of our streets and presence of infrastructure like bicycle lanes, well maintained sidewalks, safe street crossings, dedicated bus lanes and convenient access to the subway have the potential to increase both the usage and safety of these forms of transportation.</description>

      <description>A region&amp;rsquo;s climate is characterized by its usual weather conditions, seasons, and patterns in extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes. New York City (NYC) faces public health risks from extreme weather events such as heat waves and coastal storms. With climate change, the severity of some of these risks will increase. A 2013 New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) report predicts that by the 2020s, average summer temperatures in New York City will increase by 2.</description>

      <description>Every year in New York City, workers are injured on the job or become ill as a result of exposure to health hazards at work. However, most work-related illnesses and injuries are preventable – safer work environments can be achieved when workplace hazards are understood and appropriate prevention measures are put in place.
Data on work-related injuries and illness are used to show how often these preventable events occur and to identify factors that place workers at risk.</description>
