This area is the southern-most portion of the East Side \"Slums\". It is inconceivable that it can get any worse. Structures in the main consists of 3-6 story tenements of great age and poorest type. A minor number are former single family structures, long since converted to rooming houses or small apartment use, and while listed as \"Miscellaneous\" are really in most cases \"Multi-dwellings\". There has been little if any change in either rental or price range of those latter for many years because they represent minimum cost housing. In earlier years the whole lower East SIde was a dumping ground for the hordes of immigrants entering the U.S. thru N.Y.C. In recent years, however, it has been losing population rapidly and demolition and boarding up have been substantial. Foreclosures have been heavy, and also, particularly in the last two years, acquisitions by mortgages thru surrendur of deeds.Recent enforcement of the provisions of the Multi-Dwelling Law, entailing in many cases prohibitive costs to comply therewith has accounted in a large degree for the latter. This is equally true as to demolition and boarding up. A large majority of all residential structures are \"oldlaw\" (constructed prior to 1901) tenements and a substantial percentage of those still in use are 75 years or more of age. Majority of dwelling units in the multiple dwellings rent in the lowest brackets- under $25 per month and $30-35 is about the top. The square block, Cherry, Market, Monroe, Catherine Sts. is the site of Knickerbocker Village. This was intended to be a large slum clearance, low cost housing project, but its tenants are largely of a fairly good white collar class and top rents are $14-15 per room per month. Various groups are working to rehabilitate this area and in time may have material success thru concerted action in remodeling and replacement with modern low rent accomodations.

Included in the Multiple dwellings are a number of 2 and 3 family and store combinations along the avenues. Rents are from $5-15 per room depending on location and facilities as contrasted with approximately $7.50-22 in 1929. Sales values are nominal and low and vary depending upon size, typo, and location. Likewise there have been a certain number of conversions of former old single residences into small apartments numbering from 2-10 to a building. Those are in the same general rent ranges as the above. Many other former singles have been converted to roaming houses for operation as multiple dwellings. Leases on these are in quite good demand on a basis of around $100 per room per annum. This compares with a former high of $150 per room. Most of these houses contain from 12 to 15 rooms which are rented furnished for from $3.50 to $5 minimum to $10 maximum per week. These houses are saleable to a fair degree at prices ranging from $10,000-20,000 depending on size, condition and location. This represents about 50% depreciation from high prices.

There are a few old frame two family structures in here and these also have suffered a decline amounting to from 5% to 8%. Prices today vary between $3000 and $5500.

Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Arbitrarily set at $3000 to $4500 for singles since there have been no traceable sales in here recently. Two family structures have seen no activity either, and today's prices would probably be a little lower than in 1938-39, following the general trend on Staten Island. From $5000 to $8000 would include most of these. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): About the same as 1938-39, with singles in rentable condition renting from $35 to $40; units in the few available two flats priced the same. General Comments: Sales and rental prices quoted for this area may appear to be a little high considering the grading assigned here. However, the very unfavorable topography, poor appearance of surroundings and yards, wide variety of types and sizes and sparse development all have been considered in grading. This is a typical example of an area where Italians have gone in and built good and even expensive houses right next door to the most wretched hovels, and only a few yards from the swampy bed of a stream. The area has absolutely no charm, regarded as a whole, although there are a number of well constructed and expensive masonry and brick structures, typically the Mediterranean design. Small vegetable gardens are in evidence throughout the area; chickens and pigeons are a common sight, and the prevalence of wrapped-up fig trees indicates unmistakeably the high percentage of Italian dwellers. About the center line of the area, at the north end, is a pumping station, and along the north boundary (Victory Boulevard) are gas stations and auto repair shops. A small auto junk yard is situated about the center of this area. The land is lowest along the center line, north and south, and rises to the east and west. Best values are near the east and west boundaries. Two small new houses, brick bungalows were notes, both at the extreme boundaries of the area (south and west). There is plenty of room for building in here but little likelihood of any but Italians going into the area. Streets are very poor (except boundary streets) and sidewalks lacking. If anything, the trend is downward, and is certainly down as far as it can go to any but Italian buyers.

Excepting in the summer gruop, few vacancies were noted during a tour of the area. General Comments: No sales traceable here and the area appears completely stagnant. This is a cheap summer community and has seen no development and no new construction in some time. High tides discourage occupancy as wet cellars and even street and sidewalk inundation are common. Unimportant to financial institutions, which never have favored the territory as a lending area, and have little property through foreclosure.

Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): This area has seen some decline since 1938, and today's prices for singles here would range pretty generally between $1500 and $5000, with few examples toward the latter figure. There are very few two family structures here; these are in no demand, despite the fact that this is an Italian neighborhood, and would be difficult to sell at $5000 to $7000. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): About $20 to $35 for singles, or units in two family structures when available. There is a fair rental demand at $25 a month, but the demand does not extend much beyond this figure at present, and prices have apparently levelled off in the absence of any activity on this side of the Island. General Comments: There is a seaside summer hospital for children in this area. No gas in most of the area. HOLC has 15 parcels; 2 have been sold in the past year. Institutions are reported to have a few properties here but have had difficulty in selling at any but lowest prices and most favorable terms. No new construction during the past year and none probable. Cedar Grove Beach, a summer community of cheap bungalows, is adjacent on the south, but is separated from this area by an enclosure. The \"GolfClub\" indicated on the map, adjacent on the north, is in fact no more than an open field, grass grown and untended. There are a number of boarded up cottages, these being for the most part summer dwellings. An Italian restaurant, a small Italian club and a few small taverns dot the area. At the north-east corner, on Hyland Avenue is a relic of a bygone time: the one remaining PeeWee Golf Course on Staten Island. This area was viewed during a rain.

Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Only a nominal difference between 1938-39 prices- and those of today. This area has seen very little activity, due to its isolated location, unfavorable topography and the racial picture. There is practically no demand here today for anything within the range of $2000 to $4000 which pretty well brackets the area. Improvements are practically all single family dwellings. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): As nearly as can be estimated prices have not fluctuated during the past two years; home ownership is comparatively high, but those which are rented bring from $20 to $35. Only one vacancy was noted during a tour of the area, that being a small stucco house in rather poor condition, boarded up, with the HOLC sign attached. General Comments: A small stream traverses this area, from east to west- not shown on the map. Along this watercourse are some marshy spots, extending in wet weather out into the roadways. The area is bounded on the north by a steep wooded slope at the summit of which are a few fairly good houses. Italian occupancy of a considerable number of dwellings is denoted by the presence of grape arbors, chicken runs, pigeon cotes and the inevitable \"bangaled-up\" fig trees. Roads are narrow and in rather poor condition in places, and there are no sidewalks. Sheds, out-houses and miscellaneous small and shabby buildings are scattered throughout the area. Housing is very mixed as to type, size, material and condition. No planning whatever, and some small houses cling precariously to the steep slopes, while others are almost inaccessbile in wet weather because of marshy pools along the roadways in the \"bottom\".

Best values are along the beach front, which is high above the water, permitting good construction in the extreme southwest part. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): Where monthly rentals are obtained for year round occupancy, these range from $20 to $35. Summer season cottages and bungalows rent from $100 to $250 for the period June to September inclusive. By far the majority of houses here were built for summer occupancy. The demand for such in this area is fair. For year round occupancy it appears to be a little better since nearly all the houses suitable for such are occupied. General Comments: There are many very small and cheap summer bungalows on very small lots in this area. These are boarded up during the winter months, giving the area a barren appearance. The southwesterly two or three streets have recently been resurfaced with gravel, but for the most part street surfaces are poor. There are two private boat yards in the area, and during the season clam diggers operate from here.

Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): There has been absolutely no traceable activity in this small and sparsely developed area, and indicated changes in prices would be nominal and arbitrary since not a single sale could be located, despite the many offerings in evidence throughout the area. Perhaps $3500 to $6000 would be fairly descriptive of what is in the area- though none are moving at any price. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): There are probably more vacancies per given number of properties in this area than in any other spot on Staten Island. The area is small and very thinly built up- not exceeding 20%, and possibly even that is a high estimate. There are a number of moderately large old stucco houses with tile roofs, something rarely seen in this section of Staten Island. These are all vacant; some of them are boarded up and have the appearance of having been untenated for a long while. What few houses are rented in here are priced generally from $25 to $40 a month. This is the same figure as given for 1938-39. General Comments: Roads here are unpaved and some of them in deplorable condition. Seven \"ForSale\" signs were noticed during a tour of the area, besides two or three boarded up vacant houses. One rooming house caters to the employees of the nearby White Dental Manufacturing Company.

Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): No noticeable change during the past two years.

Rental Prices (Dec.1940): About the same as 1939 at $15 to $25 for singles and units in two family structures (unheated). Demand is fair and vacancies are few in properties which are in good rentable condition. General Comments: This area was formerly dependent largely upon the Tottenville ship yards, where most of the dwellers here found employment. With the closing of operations in the yards, a decline set in, from which Tottenville and the neighboring community of Richmond Valley has never recovered. About the only local source of employment today is a small copper smelting works. Some of the residents of the area work in the factories along the New Jersey shore, across Arthur Kill River. This, however, involved expensive transportation via automobile over the Outerbridge Crossing, or passage on the ferry to Perth Amboy. Those who found employment in Jersey, and were able, generally moved there. There are two small and somewhat isolated portions of this area, lying north of the Rapid Transit Railroad. These were developments of a sort, built some years ago during more prosperous times in the community. They are principally occupied by a foreign population and present a stagnant appearance, with no new construction. The western portion is somewhat better, more uniform and more accessible. Steep slopes are a detriment in the eastern part. HOLC has one house here, undergoing reconditioning, situated next to a small German tavern on a brushy hillside overlooking the railroad tracks.

Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Weaker on all classes of housing than in 1938-39. Singles are priced generally from $2000 to $6500, with little demand toward the upper end of the bracket. Most sales reported are around $4000. Two family structures are in little demand and due to institutional price cutting in the effort to reduce inventories, have come down to something like $3500 to $7500, which may be termed an arbitrary bracket inasmuch as there have been no sales reported recently. A few old three and four family dwellings, \"oldlawtenements\" are scattered throughout this area. These have been in no demand, and prices are arbitrarily mentioned as $3000 to $5500, a little lower than in 1938-39. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): No appreciable change in rents. Singles range from $20 to $45- most of them nearer the former figure: two family units at $20 to $50, the latter figure being for those where heat is supploed; flats in the old law tenements, three and four family, fall within $15 to $25, some with heat, most of them unheated. General Comments: This section was expected to improve with the coming of the Free Port immediately adjacent on the east. However, these expectations were not realized, possibly due to stringency of manufacturing laws and to other restrictions imposed. There has been very little development here accordingly, and residential districts adjoining have derived no benefits. Until recently the Zone was used for loading planes and trucks for shipment to France, but with the collapse of the French Republic this activity has ceased and the piers are for the most part idle. Best residential values and prosepcts are along the thoroughfare separating the area from the Fox Hills Golf Club property on the south (Vanderbilt Avenue). HOLC has 12 parcels in the area at present and has sold 5 since last May. No new constuction was noted during a tour of the area, and the trend is at best static and possibly downward slightly.

This is one of the poorest areas in the entire borough and has practically nothing to recommend it to the outside renter or buyer. (\/n) General comments: Most of the sparse development is along the main thoroughfare, Bloomingdale Avenue.  Inside streets are poorly surfaced, muddy in wet weather, and have no sidewalks.  Three or four small old houses in dilapidated condition have been abandoned.  HOLC has one here, an old frame two story, unpainted and boarded up, on Claypit Road, about the center of the area.  Toward the west end, development is poorest and sparsest.  Transportation is via bus at infreqent intervals; stores are few and of a poor appearance.  This is one of the most isolated settlements on Staten Island.  It is difficult to envisage any further decline, but the trend, if any would be downward.","6":"21 Sandyground, Staten Island D","31":"100","32":"","33":"","1a":"Slightly rolling","1b":"Some small stores in area","1c":"Remote from transportation.

(\/n) Sales Prices (Dec. 1940): This was a \"dead\" area long before 1938-39, and has not been marked by any changes since.  Prices, arbitrarily, are $1500 to $3000 for the miscellany of old frame cottages, houses and shacks which dot the area.  There have been few if any sales and the area has no appeal, and there is nothing to attract and outside buyer.

The area continues to be occupied, but there is certainly nothing that could be called a demand here, and the inhabitants are those who have had no opportunity to move elsewhere, or were unable to dispose of their porperty and had no recourse but to remain and live in it. (\/n) General Comments: The communtiy lies in a hollow, with hills rising gently to southward.  At the south boundary is a small cemetery.  Northward, across Arthur Kill Road are small old docks and a boat buildign yard, the scene of no activity today.  Several churches, one of them Hungarian (Magyar) are located along the main thoroughfare, Arthur Kill Road.  These are generally shabby in appearance and bear a deserted look.  A small burying ground with head stones dating back to 1805, grown up with thorns and brush, testifies to the age of the village, and to its decadence.  There are a few small boarded up shops along the main street.  Some fairly good old fashioned houses, having an owner-occupied look are out of keeping with the rest of the town.  Small taverns are fairly numerous, and the local fire department headquarters, a fairly respectable looking structure, has a large \"ForSale\" sign across its front.  No new construction was noted during a tour of the area; very few vacancies and only one or two \"forsale\" signs.

Outer fringe of area contains better property than the interior section which is low and poorly laid out, with unpaved streets, no sidewalks.  Nearly all of the interior is gully load. (\/n) Sales Price (Dec 1940): There has been some decline in the higher priced properties in here, possibly due to the cuts of similar types of Building and Loan Associations in surrounding areas.  Single houses today are quoted generally from $3000 to $5500, with little demand.  Two family structures range between $4500 to $6500, and it would be a rare occurance if one were to be sold for a higher figure.  Demand is non-existent and no sales have been made here by the more important institutions reporting. (\/n) Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): About the same as 1938-39 levels, with singles ranging from $25 to $45; two family units renting for $25 to $40, most of them unheated. There is no active demand but the area appears pretty well filled, and few vacancies were noted in the tenantable properties, although two or three small dilapidated shacks were boarded up. (\/n) General comments: The center of this area has always been notably less desirable than the outer fringes, particularly the northwest fringe, which is pretty respectable in appearance.  Some recent roadways improvement, consisting of new gravel surface, has brightened up some of the interior streets, although it has brought about no new building construction as yet.  That portion of the area lying west of the railroad and along the right of way, is of worst appearance, and it would be difficult to find a more forbidding aspect any place on Staten Island.  A low, almost vacant plot is traversed by roadways which are all but impassable in good weather, and would be a morass in the rainy season.  A few very poor houses are scattered about in this part, most of them bearing indications of Italian occupancy, i.e. pigeons, chickens, small outsheds and general trashy surroundings.  A number of small stores are located in the vicinity of the railroad station at Fingerboard Road.  Transportation faciltiies are good.

Negroes principally on Jersey St., Italians on Brighton Ave. and Park Ave. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): About 5% weaker on all types than in 1938-39, probably due in part to price cutting by institutions in attempt to clear inventories. Singles range from $1200 to $6000 with very few likely to command the latter figure. Two family structures currently quoted from $3500 to $5750, with little demand at any except sacrifice prices. The \"oldlawtenements\"- 3 to 5 family flats, of which there are a number scattered throughout the area, are arbitrarily mentioned as being worth from $2500 to $4000. However, no sales have been located to support these figures. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): Proximity to New York ferries and to business center and Administration Offices of the Borough have kept rents fairly steady here, though many of the houses and apartments offered in pretty poor condition, inside and out. Singles rent from $15 to $50; units in two flats at $20 to $50; and the \"coldwaterflats\" in 3,4 and 5 family structures bring from $15 to $25. There is a wide variation in desirability and condition of quarters in this area, and consequently an appreciable spread in brackets given above. General Comments: The United States Housing Authority is at present conducting a survey in this area with a view of carrying out slum clearance projects. It is known that investigations have been carried out and searches made on Jersey, Westervelt and Cleveland Streets within the area. Although details were not available, it is understood that the Staten Island Savings Bank not long ago sold two parcels here at about $1000 cash each, same being a 3 flat with store and a 4 family with 3 stores. High assessments, lack of restrictions, permitting business encroachment, and Italian infiltration depress residential desirability in this area. Probably the trend is downward in the absence of any clearance project. Since writing the above it has been learned that the Housing project has been finally approved to begin next spring. Construction will cost $1,559,000, and accomodations are to be provided for 264 low income families at an average rental of $19 monthly. The exact location of the site has not been announced but it is to be in New Brighton according to reports.

Few vacancies are apparent and the demand appears pretty good here as elsewhere on Staten Island. General Comments: North end subject to Baltimore and Ohio Railroad yard influence; also to offensive odors from manufacture of gas. A large storage tank is situated near the intersection of the Rapid Transit Company with Edgewater Street. This presents not only an eyesore, but a possibly source of fire or explosion. The Marine Hospital at the north boundary of the area is a fine, modern and well kept institution and probably a favorable influence in some respects. Across from this and along Vanderbilt Avenue are a lot of old but fairly well maintained houses owned by the Vanderbilt Estate- all for sale. Townsend Avenue was a fine street before the coming of the Baltimore and Ohio yards and the Gas Company's factory and tank. It is now a typical slum. A tour of the area disclosed no new construction and it would be very difficult to get a loan in this section except on the most stringent terms.

Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): About 5% lower than 1938-39 levels on singles; a little greater loss on two-flats. Today's prices on one family houses in this area would for the most part fall within the $2750-$5750 bracket, a majority being nearer the first figure. Two family dwellings are in poor demand despite the fact that this is an Italian neighborhood. About $4000 to $7000 is arbitrarily stated to be the range, though there have been few sales to support it. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): Singles rent from $20 to $40 with little or no change from 1938-39. Units in two-flats at $20 to $45, the latter figure being about right for heated units. Demand is fair and there are not many vacancies where the property is in rentable condition. Prices a little lower here for comparable houses. General Comments: This is an area which would benefit greatly by the construction of a tunnel across the Narrows as has often been mentioned during years past. The Hylan administration was particularly favorable to such a project but with the defeat of that Mayor hope seems to have waned and instead of putting in a tunnel to develop Staten Island, it is now felt that the Island should first develop to a point where a tunnel becomes necessary, and more to the point, self liquidating to a degree. Conditions are bad in this area today, and they have been bad for a long time, at least by comparison with most other sections of the Island. The racial factor, and the prevelance of cheap poor summer cottages along the south fringe; taverns, and the element attracted thereto during the warm months have all hurt the neighborhood. No new construction was noted during a tour of the area. HOLC has 21 parcels here now; has sold 6 during the current year.

Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): About 5% lower than 1938-39 levels which were for singles: $2000 to $6000; and for two family structures: $2000 to $8000. Demand is notably lacking and sales have been few in recent months although some improvement may be anticipated due to the increase in activity in the ship yards along this shore.

Some improvement may be expected due to increased activity as mentioned above. General Comments: The Negro population is understood to be increasing in this area, and to be moving also up into C-6 from here. The McWilliams ship yard, at the northeast corner of the area has recently been acquired by the National Youth Adminstration for training purposes. It is proposed to accomodate some 700 apprentices between the ages of 18 and 22 to learn shipbuilding and allied trades. Most of these are to come from Staten Island, and it is quite probable that some of the older larger houses in the neighborhood may be converted to furnish lodging for the trainees. To date many of the new jobs in the ship yards along this shore appear to have been filled from outside Staten Island, and most of these new men are still comuting if license plates on parked cars may be taken as an indication. Thus the demand for housing has not kept pace with the increase in employment locally.

Some small yards have been abandoned. Main highways: Richmond Terrace, Richmond Ave., Forest Ave., Morningstar Road. Supplemental Information: Sales Price (Dec.1940): As nearly as can be determined, about 5% lower than in 1938-39, with singles ranging from $2250 to $5750 and two family structures more or less arbitrarily priced from $4750 to $7000. Institutions have made some consistent cuts in here. Moreover, the increase in employment in local and adjacent ship yards has not yet produced the sales impetus hoped for since many of the new men commute from New Jersey and Brooklyn. It is expected that further increase will eventually result in a stimulated demand as employees are able to accumulate a reserve sufficient to enable them to buy locally. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): About the same as 1938-39 with singles bringing from $25 to $35; units in two family dwellings renting from $25 to $35, generally without heat. A tour of the area disclosed very few vacancies and the demand appears to be good with prospects of some improvement with further increases of employment in defense industries along this shore. General Comments: There has been an increase of over 2000 jobs in the ship yards just north of this area during the past year. Some complaint has been heard that preference has been given to those from outside the borough. Real estate certainly has not felt the stimulus which might be expected from so considerable an upturn in industry. There has not been much demand for housing in this area, at least no such demand as was hoped for by local realtors and others following the increases above noted. HOLC has at present 28 parcels here; 14 were sold during the past year, most of them at prices somewhat higher than have been obtained by competitors operating here. Institutions have consistently cut prices in this area but their holdings are pretty well reduced now. At present the trend here appears static.

Rental Prices (Dec.1940): About the same as 1939- $15 to $30 for singles or units in two family dwellings, though the area is not attractive to renters. Practically no demand, and not much movement to or from the area. Appears quite stagnant. General Comments: This is one of the most unattractive spots on Staten Island. Development is principally along Richmond Avenue where small poor houses and shacks are thinly strung out, interspersed with occasional one room shops and taverns. East and west of this thoroughfare the land falls off into swampy meadows. Many of the homes have tiny garden plots; trash and litter is in evidence throughout the area; paving is very poor on all but the main highway, and grape vines and bundled-up fig trees testify to the nationality of the dwellers here. Small junk yards, greenhouses, a brick yard, and a marble works penalize the area to almost any but Italian residents. At the southern extremity are two fair sized taverns at the intersection of Richmond Avenue with Victory Boulevard. Here also are gas stations and garage. There are a very few large and quite old houses, probably the first built in this neighborhood and still standing. These are along Richmond Avenue and occupy large plots but appear to be in poor condition and are not in demand at any price because of the comparatively high assessments along here. The detached portion of the area to the south and along Victory Boulevard is so sparsely settled as to be of no importance whatever. (HOLC has one large old \"wreck\" in there- the only one on the \"street\"- boarded up.) South of Victory Boulevard a little way, and visible from that thoroughfare, are large buildings of the new Asylum for mentally defective children; not yet in operation but nearing completion. This adjoins Willowbrook Park and is just east of it. Here also is a sewage disposal plant. There is some slight development a little way south of the intersection of Richmond Avenue and Victory Boulevard, not graded on the map. This portion is sparse, and not new, but somewhat better than other parts of this area and perhaps should be included therein. There are some sizable truck farms and smaller plots south of here, along Richmond Avenue, principally operated by Italians. It is hardly worth saying that there is no new construction in the area.
