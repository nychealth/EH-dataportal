      <description>Usingpublic health to prevent violenceExperiencing violence affects people in many ways. It not only causes physicalinjury or death, but being exposed to it can also cause emotional andpsychological trauma. Violence doesn’tjust affect the immediate victim, it affects their surrounding community, too.Violence can affect people throughout their lives: it is associated with worsebirth outcomes, childhood developmental delays, physical and mental illness, andpremature deaths.</description>

      <description>Violence has profound effects. An assault, a shooting, a homicide, or any use of force affects people in many deep ways.
Violence causes physical and emotional harm. It can inflict fear, a constant sense of unease. It can cause short- and long-term trauma. Violence can affect people throughout their lives - including their health. It can lead to poor birth outcomes, compromised childhood development, negative health behaviors, physical and mental illness, and premature deaths.</description>
