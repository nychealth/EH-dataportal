      <description>Imagine your child has asthma. One summer night, a powerful storm rolls in and knocks the power out.
Your child starts to have trouble breathing. Usually, you’d use a home nebulizer, an electric machine that turns liquid medicine into a mist that your child breathes in through a face mask.
But the power is out. Without the nebulizer, your child’s breathing gets worse - and you wonder, is it time to go to the hospital again?</description>

      <description>Health care is a valuable tool to stay healthy.
Health insurance coverage is associated with many health benefits. People with health insurance are more likely to have a regular doctor, receive preventive care services, better manage chronic health conditions, have longer life expectancy, and more.
However, not all New Yorkers can access appropriate amounts of care. Many New Yorkers remain uninsured. People without access to appropriate health care don&amp;rsquo;t receive the care they need to stay healthy.</description>

      <description>Death is, of course, a severe health outcome. Many deaths are preventable.
Premature mortality lets us look at deaths before age 65. It can be a useful way to indicate the overall health of the population.
Neonatal deaths, postneonatal deaths, and infant deaths let us look at deaths among the the youngest members of our communities. Infants, with new, developing bodies, can be very susceptible to environmental threats - like poisonings, accidents, and injuries.</description>

      <description>A region&amp;rsquo;s climate is characterized by its usual weather conditions, seasons, and patterns in extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes. New York City (NYC) faces public health risks from extreme weather events such as heat waves and coastal storms. With climate change, the severity of some of these risks will increase. A 2013 New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) report predicts that by the 2020s, average summer temperatures in New York City will increase by 2.</description>

      <title>Protecting New Yorkers from extreme heat</title>

      <description>Hot weather is dangerous. In New York City and across the country, more people on average die from extreme heat each year than from all other natural disasters.
Heat stress happens when your body’s temperature increases quickly. When the body can no longer control its temperature or cool itself down, it can lead to death.
At the NYC Health Department, we track heat stress deaths by reviewing causes of death recorded by the Bureau of Vital Statistics.</description>
