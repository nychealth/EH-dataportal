      <description>Climate, including extreme weather, has a direct impact on health. As NYC&amp;rsquo;s climate changes, along with the world&amp;rsquo;s climate, we expect more frequent and intense heat waves, increased rainfall and more severe storms. These will add to existing weather-related risks. Already, heat kills more people than all other natural disasters combined.
In New York City, those most vulnerable to the dangers of hot weather are older adults and people with health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive impairment - especially those in low-income, Black, and Brown communities.</description>

      <description>Extreme heat is dangerous. It can cause heat-related illness, make chronic conditions worse, and even kill. The weather forecast is our best way to predict heat-related health outcomes. We can also track heat-related illness with near real-time electronic data from emergency departments at hospitals throughout NYC.</description>
