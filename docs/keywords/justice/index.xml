      <description>Housing stability creates health, but in NYC, many people have difficulty accessing healthy, stable housing.
In some neighborhoods, residents at are higher risk of being displaced - forced to leave their homes, and their neighborhoods, due combinations of market pressure, rent burden, housing conditions, poverty, and injustice in the housing market.

      <description>Inequality is a significant driver of bad health: a society that deprives people of resources to stay healthy is a society where many people become sick, injured, or die because of factors outside of their control.
People tend to be healthier when they have access to economic and financial stability, higher education, adequate health care, healthy neighborhoods, and safe, strong communities.
Health inequities are systematic differences in health outcomes that result from differences in access to the conditions that keep people healthy.</description>
