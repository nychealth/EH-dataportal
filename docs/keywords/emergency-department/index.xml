      <description>Extreme heat is dangerous. It can cause illness, make chronic conditions worse, and even kill. Heat-related illnesses happen when the body cannot cool down enough, and include heat exhaustion, muscle cramps, fainting and heat stroke, the most serious form of heat-related illness. Heat can exacerbate chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases or kidney conditions, that may not be recognized or labeled as heat-related.
The weather forecast is the best way to predict heat-related health outcomes.</description>
