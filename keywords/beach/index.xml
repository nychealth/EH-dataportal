      <description>One month before New York City&amp;rsquo;s beaches open to the public, the Health Departments starts sampling and monitoring beaches. Sampling provides data about current water quality conditions, and monitoring identifies sources of pollution that affect water quality.&#xA;Each beach is monitored and sampled every week, except for Rockaway and Breezy Point beaches, which are sampled twice each week. Samples are tested for bacteria, debris, animal waste, medical or infectious waste, toxic contaminants, petroleum products, and sewage and wastewater discharge following heavy rainfall.</description>
