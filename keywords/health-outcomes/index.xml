      <description>Our environment - the world around us - affects our health. Here are datasets on health outcomes that people experience that may be linked to the environment.&#xA;Some of these have clear links to the environment, like lead poisoning. Others have some uncertain links, and are still being investigated and understood.&#xA;But while specific health outcomes may have stronger or weaker links to the environment, the environment&amp;rsquo;s overall effect on our health is clear - we know that one of the strongest predictors of health is where you&amp;rsquo;re born.</description>
