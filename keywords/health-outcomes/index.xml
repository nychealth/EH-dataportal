      <description>Our environment - the world around us - affects our health. Here are datasets on health outcomes that people experience that may be linked to the environment.
Some of these have clear links to the environment, like lead poisoning. Others have some uncertain links, and are still being investigated and understood.
But while specific health outcomes may have stronger or weaker links to the environment, the environment&amp;rsquo;s overall effect on our health is clear - we know that one of the strongest predictors of health is where you&amp;rsquo;re born.</description>
