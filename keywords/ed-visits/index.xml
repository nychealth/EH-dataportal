      <description>Violence has profound effects. An assault, a shooting, a homicide, or any use of force affects people in many deep ways.&#xA;Violence causes physical and emotional harm. It can inflict fear, a constant sense of unease. It can cause short- and long-term trauma. Violence can affect people throughout their lives - including their health. It can lead to poor birth outcomes, compromised childhood development, negative health behaviors, physical and mental illness, and premature deaths.</description>

      <description>Poverty affects health in many ways. In New York City, the story of asthma clearly illustrates this connection.&#xA;To understand the connection between poverty and asthma, take a look at this map of poverty rates in New York City, below. The darker the color, the more residents living in poverty.&#xA;Now, compare that to a map of emergency department visits for asthma in children age 5 to 17, below. The darker the color, the higher the rate of children visiting the emergency department with asthma.</description>
