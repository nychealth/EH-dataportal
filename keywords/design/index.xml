      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re making changes, and we need your help.&#xA;A few months ago, when we redesigned the home page of the Environment &amp;amp; Health Data Portal, we wrote that we were working toward &amp;ldquo;building a system that works: thatâ€™s intuitive and makes our information clear and easy-to-find.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As a government agency, we&amp;rsquo;re committed to making information available via the web. By doing this well, we hope that people can use this information to change their lives and their communities.</description>
