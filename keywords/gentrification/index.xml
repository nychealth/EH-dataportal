      <description>Housing stability creates health, but in NYC, many people have difficulty accessing healthy, stable housing.
In some neighborhoods, residents at are higher risk of being displaced - forced to leave their homes, and their neighborhoods, due combinations of market pressure, rent burden, housing conditions, poverty, and injustice in the housing market.
To show people&amp;rsquo;s risk of being forced out of their homes or neighborhoods, the Department of City Planning and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development created a Displacement Risk Index, part of the Equitable Development Data Explorer.</description>

      <description>Asthma is a common disease that makes breathing difficult, causing coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.
Things in our environment can trigger asthma or make symptoms worse - like air pollution (like fine particulates, ozone, or diesel exhaust); unhealthy housing conditions (dust mites, cockroaches, mold); or things like pollen, pets, or tobacco smoke.
Asthma is a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and missed school days. Emergency department visits for asthma are concentrated in higher-poverty neighborhoods, as poor housing quality and less access to preventive health care create barriers to managing asthma.</description>
