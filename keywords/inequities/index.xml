      <description>Health is determined by many factors, and people tend to be healthier when they have economic stability, live in quality housing and have access to public space and safe, connected communities.

New Yorkers shared personal stories that illuminate their priorities for building healthier neighborhoods, healthier childhoods and more.

The racial wealth gap has major implications for public health.</description>
