      <description>Lead poisoning affects adults too Lead is a harmful metal that can cause serious health issues. When lead poisoning makes headlines, the focus is usually on childrenâ€™s health: Kids are at higher risk for lead exposure, which can cause developmental, learning and behavior issues.
