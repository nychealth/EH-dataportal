      <description>Injury deaths among young and middle-aged adults in New York City: with a focus on homicide and suicide Young and middle-aged adults (ages 15 to 44) do not typically die from the natural causes that kill older adults. Injuries, both intentional — violence or suicide — and unintentional, dominate as causes of death.
