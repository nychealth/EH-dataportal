      <title>How power outages affect health</title>

      <description>Imagine your child has asthma. One summer night, a powerful storm rolls in and knocks the power out.&#xA;Your child starts to have trouble breathing. Usually, you’d use a home nebulizer, an electric machine that turns liquid medicine into a mist that your child breathes in through a face mask.&#xA;But the power is out. Without the nebulizer, your child’s breathing gets worse - and you wonder, is it time to go to the hospital again?</description>

      <title>Climate and health</title>
      <link>https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/key-topics/climatehealth/</link>

      <description>Climate, including extreme weather, has a direct impact on health. As NYC&amp;rsquo;s climate changes, along with the world&amp;rsquo;s climate, we expect more frequent and intense heat waves, increased rainfall and more severe storms. These will add to existing weather-related risks. Already, heat kills more people than all other natural disasters combined.&#xA;In New York City, those most vulnerable to the dangers of hot weather are older adults and people with health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive impairment - especially those in low-income, Black, and Brown communities.</description>

      <description>The weather forecast is the best way to predict heat-related health outcomes.&#xA;We can also track heat-related illness with near real-time electronic data from emergency departments at hospitals throughout NYC. These data include illnesses directly attributed to heat (including heat exhaustion, muscle cramps, fainting and heat stroke), not the full burden of heat-related health impacts.</description>

      <description>In New York City and across the country, more people die from extreme heat than from all other natural disasters combined. To understand how to keep New Yorkers safe from extreme heat, we studied neighborhood factors that affect temperature, and found that grass, shrubs, and trees can play a major role. Let’s take a look.&#xA;At 6.00 PM on June 30, 2018, the air temperature at the LaGuardia Airport Weather Station was 89° Fahrenheit (F).</description>

      <description>Hot weather is dangerous. In New York City and across the country, more people on average die from extreme heat each year than from all other natural disasters.&#xA;Heat stress happens when your body’s temperature increases quickly. When the body can no longer control its temperature or cool itself down, it can lead to death.&#xA;At the NYC Health Department, we track heat stress deaths by reviewing causes of death recorded by the Bureau of Vital Statistics.</description>
