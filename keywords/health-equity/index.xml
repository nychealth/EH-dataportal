      <description>Health is determined by many factors. People tend to be healthier when they have economic stability, live in quality housing and have access to public space and safe, connected communities. In 2020, the NYC Health Department held a series of community conversations with residents and local stakeholders across 26 neighborhoods. New Yorkers shared personal stories about their priorities for building healthier neighborhoods, healthier childhoods and more. This is one part of a three-part series on how housing, economic stability, and public space create health.</description>

      <description>Throughout history, the distribution of wealth in the U.S. has, and continues to be, largely unequal between racial groups. This concept is referred to as the racial wealth gap and it has its roots in settler colonialism and enslavement. There is an especially big wealth disparity between White families and Black families, which was established and upheld by racist historical policies and practices. The racial wealth gap has major implications for public health.</description>

      <description>Inequality is a significant driver of bad health: a society that deprives people of resources to stay healthy is a society where many people become sick, injured, or die because of factors outside of their control.&#xA;People tend to be healthier when they have access to economic and financial stability, higher education, adequate health care, healthy neighborhoods, and safe, strong communities.&#xA;Health inequities are systematic differences in health outcomes that result from differences in access to the conditions that keep people healthy.</description>
