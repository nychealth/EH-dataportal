We work to make data easier to access, understand, and use - on the belief that when we do so, we make our data - and our knowledge - more influential. Much of the data on the Environment & Health Data Portal comes through partnerships with the many experts here at the Health Department.

Perhaps your work would benefit from being published - making data accessible, explaining why things are they way they are, and creating useful tools that other people can use to understand or explain the issue. 

**Our team can help**. To help get your information to the web, we can provide:
- Strategic support on data strategy and communication strategy
- Technical support on data visualization and web development
- A web presence

Here are some ways we can partner:

### Adding indicators 
We can add your datasets to the website. Datasets that fit in with the website have an environmental angle, data at the neighborhood level, and trend data. 

We can add indicators to any of our [existing topics](/data-explorer), or we can create a new topic with several new indicators. 

Contact our team to strategize about what we can do with your indicators, and how we can add them to the portal. We can provide some simple templates and easily upload the datasets. 

### Writing data stories
Our data stories are among the highest-traffic pages on the portal. They go beyond simply publishing data - they *explain* data in powerful ways and shine a light on important findings and perspectives. 

Our goal is to use data to illuminate the city around us, and use data stories to engage and inform people, and explain important topics - and connect people to additional resources. 

Our data stories:
- Use data to provide insight into an environmental health topic
- Explain important connections - explaining "the why" of an issue, or showing how one thing is related to another
- Provide expert insight that might not be immediately noticeable just in the data

We use a few in-house styles: informal, conversational tone, an 8th grade (or below) reading level, and explanation-oriented visualization standards (as opposed to scientific or academic standards).

### Creating custom interactives
Sometimes, our default Data Explorer visualizations aren't suited to explaining a dataset. In those instances, a custom interactive can best explain the data. For examples, see [Heat Syndrome](/key-topics/climatehealth/syndromic) and [Realtime Air Quality](/key-topics/airquality/realtime).

While "dashboards" often let people explore and hypothesize, we aim to keep these custom interactives *explanatory*: focused and message-oriented. 

If you're interested in something like this, reach out and we can see what we can do together. 

### Publishing annual reports
[PDFs are "unfit for human consumption"](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pdf-unfit-for-human-consumption/). If your program produces an annual report or a data report, consider publishing it as a webpage instead of as a PDF. This can be:
- Better-designed and better-looking
- More engaging and easier to read
- Easier to update each year

For examples, see [the NYCCAS Annual Report](/key-topics/airquality/nyccas) or the [Heat Mortality Report](/key-topics/climatehealth/heat-report), which we are in the process of converting to full, Portal-based Web products.

## If you don't work in the Health Department
While a lot of our partnerships are internal, we do collaborate with people outside the Health Department. if you'd like to:
- Ask questions about an issue that could be answered with data
- Partner on projects to explore environmental health issues 
- Access and use data

...then send us an email at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#101;&#104;&#100;&#112;&#64;&#104;&#101;&#97;&#108;&#116;&#104;&#46;&#110;&#121;&#99;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;">&#101;&#104;&#100;&#112;&#64;&#104;&#101;&#97;&#108;&#116;&#104;&#46;&#110;&#121;&#99;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;</a>. We'd love to hear from you.
