Mental health is a person’s emotional, psychological, and social wellbeing. It is an important part of overall health.

Mental illness can include depression, serious psychological distress, hospitalization for psychiatric reasons, and even suicide.

Many factors can contribute to mental illness. Poor mental health is associated with a variety of risk factors. These include chronic disease, poverty, and poor environmental conditions. Many adults with mental illness do not receive the treatment they need.

### Mental health and the environment
A person’s environment affects their mental health.

**Neighborhood factors** like green space, noise, and infrastructure can affect mental health. People who say their neighborhood gives them more opportunities to be physically active are less likely to report poor mental health.

People exposed to **poor housing quality** (like housing maintenance issues and pests) are more likely to report poor mental health.

Living in **high poverty** neighborhoods is associated with depression, serious psychological distress, and psychiatric hospitalization.

**Experiencing violence** is also a risk factor: depression is higher among those who report that their neighborhood is not very safe, and those who have ever been hurt by an intimate partner.

Even climate change is a risk: extreme heat is associated with mood disorders and anxiety, and disasters such as floods and hurricanes result in trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder, and poorer mental health.
