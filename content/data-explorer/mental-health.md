Mental health is an important part of overall health. Mental illnesseses are mental and behavioral patterns that cause distress and functional problems.

The causes of mental illnesses are complex and varied. They include individual characteristics, like a person's biochemistry, but also thinkgs like access to resources for wellbeing, access to health care, and other social and environmental components.

Even things like the presence of green space in a city can effect people's mental wellbeing. [Studies have shown that increasing a neighborhood's green space can improve residents' self-reported mental health](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2688343).

Other environmental factors include:
- Noise, which can affect sleep
- Pests and other housing conditions, which can increase residents' distress
- Access to health care
