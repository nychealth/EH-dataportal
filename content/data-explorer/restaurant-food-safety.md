New York City has approximately 24,000 restaurants that the Health Department inspects every year to monitor compliance with city and state food safety regulations. At the end of an inspection, the Health Department gives restaurants a score, which is eventually converted to a grade of A, B or C. This site describes the distribution of A grades across New York City restaurants.

### Restaurant Food Safety and Health

Safe food handling can protect diners from foodborne illness. During inspections, health inspectors look to ensure that restaurants and their employees are maintaining proper food safety practices. They measure food temperature; look for evidence of food contamination; check for roaches and other vermin; and examine a restaurant's cooking, refrigeration, and cleaning equipment. If the inspector finds violations, she marks points on her inspection checklist. More points mean a lower grade. If conditions are so bad that they pose a public health hazard, the Health Department may close the restaurant until they are fixed.

### About the Data and Indicators

The NYC Health Department began issuing grades and requiring restaurants to post them in July 2010. This portal presents the number and percent of restaurants operating with an A in New York City. The information is updated quarterly.
