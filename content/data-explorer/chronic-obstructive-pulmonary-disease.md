Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a group of diseases that include emphysemia and chronic bronchitis.

These diseases can cause severe breathing problems. Over 16 million Americans have COPD, and it is the third-leading cause of death in the USA. 

Though there is no cure for COPD, it can be treated and managed. One important way to manage COPD is to reduce environmental exposure to things that can exacerbate COPD, like tobacco smoke, indoor air pollution, and outdoor air pollution. 

Some people with COPD rely on supplemtal oxygen or similar electric medical equipment, placing them at greater risk of health effects due to power outages.
