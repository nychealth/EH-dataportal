Childhood lead poisoning is a serious but preventable public health problem. Lead is a toxic metal that can cause learning and behavior problems, and delay physical growth and mental development. Testing for lead poisoning is a key component of childhood lead poisoning prevention, since most children with elevated blood lead levels exhibit no symptoms.

This site provides data on blood lead testing and on elevated blood lead levels among NYC children. The data are collected by the NYC Health Department's [Healthy Homes Program](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/lead-poisoning-prevention.page).

### Childhood Lead Exposure and Health

Lead is found naturally in the environment but is also found in manufactured products. In the past, it was used in products such as gasoline and paint, ceramic products, caulking and pipes and solder, but its use in these products has been dramatically reduced. In 1960, NYC banned the use of lead-based paint in homes. A national ban came into effect in 1978. Leaded gasoline was phased out beginning in the 1970's. However, lead can still be found in some products and in our environment. People may be exposed to lead by absorbing, breathing or swallowing lead or lead dust. Once it enters the body, lead can become a health hazard. Children are more vulnerable to lead poisoning in the first six years of life, particularly the first three, when the brain grows the fastest, and when critical connections in the brain and nervous system that control thought, learning, hearing, movement, behavior and emotions are formed. 

Lead paint is the primary cause of childhood lead poisoning in NYC.  Other sources include imported foods, spices, toys and cosmetics; water in buildings with older pipes; uncovered soil in play areas; travel to countries where environmental lead is poorly controlled.  [HHP educates families](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/health-tools/childhood-lead-poisoning.page "Open the Childhood Lead Poisoning page in a new tab") about things they can do to reduce these exposures and prevent childhood lead poisoning.

### About the Data and Indicators

This section of the portal provides indicators and measures on children tested for lead poisoning before the age of three and on children with blood lead levels of 5 mcg/dL or greater. In 2012, CDC established that a blood lead level of 5 mcg/dL is the reference level for exposure to lead in children. This level is used to identify children who have blood lead levels higher than most children's levels. The reference level is determined by measuring the NHANES blood lead distribution in US children ages 1 to 5 years, and is reviewed every 4 years.

Data on lead paint hazards, the most common source of lead exposure for children, can be found under the topic “Built Environment” on this portal. Additional lead data are available through [publications and annual reports to City Council](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/lead-pubs.page "Open the Lead health publications page in a new tab").

### Prevention

To prevent exposure to lead hazards you can do the following:

* Call 311 if your landlord does not fix peeling paint, or if you think repair work is being done unsafely.
* Call 311 if you live in a one- or two-family house with peeling paint and have a child under six years old. Ask for the Health Department's Healthy Homes Program (HHP).
* Wash floors, window sills, hands, toys and pacifiers often.
* Do not use imported foods, spices, clay pots and dishes,medicines, toys and cosmetics that have been found to contain lead.

All children should be tested for lead poisoning at ages one and two. Health care providers should also test other children found to be at risk and annually assess children from six months to six years of age for lead exposure risk.

### Key Messages

Childhood lead poisoning in NYC has declined dramatically over the last decade.  
  
The main source of childhood lead poisoning in the United States is lead-based paint in older, deteriorated housing. Chipping, flaking and peeling paint and paint disturbed during home remodeling contributes to lead dust and contaminates bare soil around a home. Children can be exposed by eating lead-based paint chips, chewing on objects painted with lead-based paint or swallowing house dust or soil that contains lead.
