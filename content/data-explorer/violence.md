Violence is the use of physical, verbal, and/or emotional force to injure, harm, abuse, damage, or destroy. Its persistent and inequitable contributions to morbidity and premature mortality in NYC make it a public health priority. Violence disproportionately affects groups oppressed as a result of their socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, geographic location, or some combination of these factors 

Violence is frequently described through homicide statistics. While homicide is a leading cause of death and captures the most severe form of violence, non-fatal violence-related injuries are much more common and help paint the larger picture on the burden of violence and its impact on the health and future of individuals, families, and communities. 

Data that capture non-fatal violence-related injuries are best understood when integrating details on the context for the violence and the systems that gives rise to. Interpreting data this way illuminates ways to mitigate the social, political, economic, historical, and environmental factors that contribute to violence. Some of these factors include:
- Firearms as the source of violence 
- Poverty and neighborhood disinvestment 
- Housing and historic redlining practices 
- Education and employment opportunities 
- Policing and incarceration practices 
- Chronic stress and intergenerational trauma Community and social norms 
- Access to health and health care 
- Built environment 

### Data sources and analysis
Analyses of non-fatal violence-related injuries feature data from New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS 2018-2021). These data were cut by NYSDOH in November 2023. Internal analyses by New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene were conducted in April 2024. Because of slight variations between datasets, results might differ from those calculated using a different extract of SPARCS. 

All calculations include hospitalizations and emergency department visits involving a firearm that are categorized with intent as intentional, undetermined, unintentional or legal intervention/war operations – meaning all firearm related visits in NYC are considered as indicators of non-fatal violence. Firearm visits categorized as intentional self-harm are excluded.  

The number of NYC non-fatal assault hospitalizations and emergency department visits were identified using the following International Classification of Disease Clinical Modification (ICD10-CM) codes: T36, T38-T52, T54-T60, T62-T63, T65, T71, T74, T76, W32-W34, X92-X99, Y00-Y04, Y07-Y09, Y22-Y24, Y35, Y38. 

Only live discharges and initial encounters are included.

All figures include NYC residents only. 

Rates are age-specific and age-adjusted.  Age-specific rates involve the number of non-fatal violence-related injury hospitalizations and ED visits among NYC residents 15-34 years old, divided by the NYC population of 15-34 year olds, using NYC DOHMH intercensal estimates; they are expressed as visits per 100,000 residents. Age-adjusted rates involve the number of non-fatal violence-related injury hospitalizations and ED visits among NYC residents summed within five age groups (0-17, 18-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65+) and divided by the population in each age group, using NYC DOHMH intercensal estimates. Quotients are multiplied by the proportion of the 2000 US population in each age group. The age-adjusted rate is the sum of the weighted age-specific rates, expressed as cases per 100,000 residents. NYC DOHMH population estimates are modified from US Census Bureau interpolated intercensal population estimates, 2000-2021. Updated September 2022.
