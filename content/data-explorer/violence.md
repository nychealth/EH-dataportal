Violence is the use of physical, verbal, and/or emotional force to injure, harm, abuse, damage, or destroy. Its persistent and inequitable contributions to morbidity and premature mortality in NYC make it a public health priority. Violence disproportionately affects groups oppressed as a result of their socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, geographic location, or some combination of these factors. 

Violence is frequently described through homicide statistics. While homicide is a leading cause of death and captures the most severe form of violence, non-fatal violence-related injuries are much more common and help paint the larger picture on the burden of violence and its impact on the health and future of individuals, families, and communities.  

Data that capture non-fatal violence-related injuries are best understood when integrating details on the context for the violence and the systems that gives rise to. Interpreting data this way illuminates ways to mitigate the social, political, economic, historical, and environmental factors that contribute to violence. Some of these factors include:
- Firearms as the source of interpersonal violence  
- Poverty and neighborhood disinvestment  
- Housing and historic redlining practices  
- Education and employment opportunities  
- Built environment  

The implications of community violence on disproportionately impacted communities include long-term psychological trauma, reduced economic opportunities, deteriorated social cohesion, and increased healthcare costs. This pervasive violence disrupts daily life, hinders educational attainment, and perpetuates cycles of poverty and crime.  

As community violence continues to pose significant challenges, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s Violence Prevention Initiative (VPI) seeks to address the root causes and consequences through a multi-faceted, community-centered approach. VPI seeks to strengthen neighborhoods disproportionally burdened by violence. Rooted in principles of health equity, VPI values a multi-strategy, trauma-informed approach to reduce risk factors that contribute to violence. VPI highlights the social context that leads to violence in disinvested communities, prioritizes solutions that help address behavioral and structural barriers, and works across systems and communities to reinvest in neighborhoods most affected by violence.  

Reflecting these public health principles is the Cure Violence model, which treats violence as a contagious disease by employing trained community members to mediate conflicts and prevent escalation, plays a crucial role in addressing immediate violence and its root causes. Hospital-based violence intervention programs (HVIPs) also contribute by providing support and resources to victims at critical moments, facilitating their recovery and preventing retaliatory violence. Programming occurs where public health data show the greatest community impacts.
