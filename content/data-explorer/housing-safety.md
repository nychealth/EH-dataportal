Most people spend most of their time in their home. That makes the home a crucial environment that can affect one's health - both in terms of safety characteristics within the home, and in terms of factors that affect housing stability.

### Safety characteristics
A home's safety characteristics might include:
- Air conditioning, which is a vital tool to protect people who are at risk of heat-related illness and death
- Electric medical equipment. People who rely on electric medical equipment are at risk during power outages.
- Grab bars in bathrooms, which can help older people and people with mobility impairments stay safe.
