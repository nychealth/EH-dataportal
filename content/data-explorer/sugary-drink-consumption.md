Sugary drinks contribute to a higher-calorie diet, long-term weight gain, and increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. Sugary drinks provide little or no nutritional value, and because they don’t fill you up the way food does, you end up consuming more calories. Also, food and beverage portion sizes have exploded over the past several decades, and studies have shown that when given larger portions, people consume more without recognizing it.

### Sugary Drinks and Health

Obesity is at epidemic proportions in New York City. More than half of New York City adults (58%) are overweight or obese; nearly 40% of New York City’s public school students (K-8) are obese or overweight; and the percentage of adults with diagnosed diabetes is increasing, with nearly 10% of New Yorkers now diagnosed with diabetes.

### About the Data and Indicators

Sugary drink consumption indicators presented on this site are derived from the annual NYC Youth Risk Behavior Surveys and the Community Health Surveys. They are estimates that depend on study participants' accurate recollections and reporting.

### Prevention

Make healthier choices:

* Drink plenty of water; nothing quenches thirst better than water.
* Choose fat-free or 1% milk.
* Switch from juice to whole fruit; whole fruit has fewer calories, and unlike juice, it has fiber.
* Skip sports drinks and energy drinks; most are high in sugar and low in nutrients, and energy drinks are loaded with caffeine.
* Pass on the high-calorie sweetened coffee and tea drinks; instead, order your coffee or tea plain and lightly flavor it yourself.
* Choose smaller portions.

### Key Messages

Sugary drinks are a major contributor to obesity – and obesity is a risk factor for heart disease and diabetes.  
  
Residents of poor neighborhoods consume more sugary drinks than residents of wealthier neighborhoods.   
  
There are numerous healthy alternatives to sugary drinks, such as water, seltzer, fat-free or 1% milk, and unsweetened tea.
