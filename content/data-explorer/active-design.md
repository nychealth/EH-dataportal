Physical activity and healthy eating are among the leading ways to get and stay healthy.

Active design is an applied, evidence-informed approach to improve physical, mental and social health outcomes through the design of the built environment.

To improve health, we can:

- Increase access to public parks and recreation
- Create pedestrian plazas, and maintain sidewalks
- Plant street trees
- Provide safer cycling infrastructure and secure bicycle storage
- Make stairways attractive and accessible

Strategies like these can have a measurable effect on peopleâ€™s ability to safely maintain their physical, mental, and social health.
