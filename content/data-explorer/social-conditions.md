Social and economic conditions affect people’s health. These conditions (also called “social determinants of health”) are conditions that people may be born into or fall into over the course of their lives. 

People tend to be healthier when they have access to:

* Economic and financial stability
* Higher education
* Adequate health care
* Healthy neighborhoods and safe, strong communities

But when people don’t have access to these conditions, they experience worse health outcomes. Discrimination based on race (and other personal or social characteristics) results in disparities in access to resources that protect and maintain health – and thus, results in unfair disparities in health outcomes. This is **health inequity** – **avoidable and unfair health outcomes.**
