Rats and mice are common, but preventable. In NYC, rats tend to be seen on streets and sidewalks, and in yards and basements, while mice are almost always found inside homes.

Rats and mice thrive where there are sources of food and shelter and where property owners fail to prevent and adequately respond to their presence.

### Mice, Rats and Health

The presence of rats in communities has been historically associated with a variety of infectious diseases. Today, rats are principally recognized for their contribution to neighborhood stress, poor quality of life, contamination of food, and for their contribution to the destruction of infrastructure. Mice can contaminate food, and their urine and dander are potent allergens, which can exacerbate the symptoms of asthma in sensitive people.

### Prevention

Simple steps can be taken to prevent mice and rats both inside and outside:

- Report evidence of, or conditions that attract rats and mice to property owners.

- Keep food sealed tightly and remove garbage and clutter from your home.

- Keep yards and outdoor areas trimmed to avoid creating a harbor for mice and rats.

### Key Messages

Beginning in 2008, the Department of Health began to systematically and pro-actively evaluate the presence of rats in Bronx neighborhoods in a program referred to as "rat indexing." By rapidly notifying property owners, providing detailed advice on how to improve conditions, and by engaging the public, the Department now encourages whole blocks and neighborhoods to simultaneously concentrate their resources to maximize the effect of extermination and cleanup efforts.
