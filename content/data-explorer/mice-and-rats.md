Rats and mice are common, but preventable. In NYC, rats tend to be seen on streets, alleys and sidewalks, and in yards and basements, while mice are almost always found inside buildings.

Rats and mice thrive where there are sources of food and shelter and where property owners fail to prevent and adequately respond to their presence.

### Mice, Rats and Health

Today, rats are recognized for their contribution to neighborhood stress, poor quality of life, contamination of food, potential threat to public health, and for their contribution to the destruction of infrastructure. Mice can contaminate food, and their urine and dander are potent allergens, which can exacerbate the symptoms of asthma in sensitive people.

### Prevention

Simple steps can be taken to prevent mice and rats both inside and outside:

- Report evidence of, or conditions that attract rats and mice to 311. Property owners are responsible for keeping their properties free of pests.

- Clean up. Garbage and clutter give rats and mice a place to eat and nest.

- Store all your food and food waste in hard side containers with tight fitting lids whether it’s inside or outside of the building.

- Seal up cracks and holes inside and outside your building or apartment to prevent the free movement of rats and mice.

- Keep yards and outdoor areas trimmed and free of clutter to avoid creating a harbor for rats.

### Key Messages

The NYC Health Department uses an inspection technique called “rat indexing” to proactively evaluate the presence of rats in NYC neighborhoods. Rat indexing allows the Department to assess entire neighborhoods for their rat activity and rapidly notify property owners of conditions found on their properties. Both private properties and public properties receive detailed advice on what conditions were found and how to improve them. By engaging the public, the Department encourages whole blocks and neighborhoods to simultaneously concentrate their resources to maximize the effect of neighborhood level extermination and cleanup efforts. Free training is provided to property owners, managers, and city agency staff. Visit www.nyc.gov/rats to learn more.
