Democracy is a public health intervention. 

One way you can take action on environmental health issues is to contact your elected officials about what is affecting you and your neighbors right now. This page will help you find your elected officials and their contact information, and help you write an email or give them a phone call. Your voice matters: each call or e-mail is typically logged and referenced when making new policies that affect your block, district, city, and state.
