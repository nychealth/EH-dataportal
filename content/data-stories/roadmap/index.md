In 2020, we partnered with [Open Tech Strategies](https://opentechstrategies.com/) to review the Environment and Health Data Portal and plan for its future development.

Open Tech Strategies prepared a report with recommendations for our strategy and technology that would help us re-develop the site to better serve our users (you). It covers:

- Open source software
- Modular contracting
- Communication strategies
- User research
- Workflows and internal tools to support this work

[You can read the full report here](ehdp-open-path-development-2020.pdf).
