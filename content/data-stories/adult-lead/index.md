### Lead poisoning affects adults, too 

Lead is a harmful metal that can cause serious health problems. When lead poisoning makes headlines, the focus is usually on children’s health: kids are at higher risk for lead exposure, which can cause developmental, learning and behavior problems. 

But lead can also harm adults. In adults, lead can cause increased blood pressure, kidney and brain problems, infertility and impotence. During pregnancy, lead exposure can cause miscarriage or babies to be born too soon or too small. 

There is no safe blood lead level at any age: even low levels of lead in the blood can cause health problems. Chronic exposure can make lead build up in the body, and the longer you have been exposed, the more difficult it is for your body to get rid of lead.  

Most people with elevated blood lead levels don’t look or feel sick, which can make lead poisoning hard to identify. The only way to know if you have been exposed to lead is to get a blood lead test. 

### The good news: Blood lead levels among New Yorkers are declining 

This continued drop in blood lead levels is likely due to work that reduced lead exposures from food, water, air, paint and consumer products.  

Stricter laws and regulations, prevention strategies such as screening at-risk populations, and public education and outreach have helped. 

For example, New York State law requires that health care providers check pregnant people and those at risk for elevated blood lead levels. And federal law requires employers to monitor (regularly test) workers at jobs that put them at a higher risk for lead exposure, such as construction.

### Even with improvements, adult lead poisoning remains a persistent problem 

Between 2016 and 2018, about 1,750 New Yorkers aged 16 or older (a rate of 15 people per 100,000) had blood lead levels of 10 micrograms per deciliter or higher—the level the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses to define an elevated blood lead level for adults.

When somebody is tested for lead in the blood, the NYC Health Department receives the results. When we learn that somebody has an elevated blood lead level, we start an investigation. We ask a long list of questions to find out how the person was exposed to lead and recommend ways for the person to reduce or eliminate their lead exposure.  

This helps us protect New Yorkers with elevated blood lead levels and learn how New Yorkers are exposed to lead. Here’s what we have found: 

In NYC, the most common source of lead exposure among non-pregnant adults is from construction-related jobs. Workers can breathe in or ingest lead dust or fumes during renovations, repairs and demolitions that disturb old lead-based paint. Work or hobbies related to metalwork, antique restoration, firearms or crafts involving materials with lead can also put adults at risk.  

Consumer products can also expose people to lead. During our investigations, we pay special attention to consumer products from other countries: certain health remedies, foods and spices, cultural powders and traditional cook ware. Lead is sometimes added to these products, either accidentally or intentionally. However, lead is typically not listed on the label, so it’s hard to tell the difference between safe and dangerous products. (For more information, visit www.nyc.gov/hazardousproducts.) 

As part of our investigations, we work to get these products off NYC store shelves before they endanger people by:  

* Routinely visiting shops where we think lead containing products might be sold 

* Tracing hazardous products back to the stores where people bought them, if reportedly purchased in NYC 

* Taking action when we find hazardous products for sale

We buy products from NYC stores and send them to a lab for testing. Between 2017 and 2021:  

<div class="row my-2 border-top border-bottom py-2">
    <div class="col-md-6" ><p class="fs-xl">We tested around...<br>
    <span style="font-size:50px; font-weight:bold;">4,000</span><br>
    products</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 text-right">
    <p class="fs-xl">...and found that over<br>
    <span style="font-size:50px; font-weight:bold">1,800</span><br>
    had detectable levels of lead.</p>
    </div>
</div>

When we identify a product that has more lead than the allowable limits, we take enforcement actions to protect New Yorkers. We order the shops to stop selling the contaminated products and require them to post warning signs to inform their customers about the dangers of these products.  

Since 2010, we’ve surveyed over 1,800 businesses and removed over 30,000 hazardous consumer products from store shelves. You can <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Metal-Content-of-Consumer-Products-Tested-by-the-N/da9u-wz3r" target="_blank"> find more data on consumer products we test on Open Data.</a>

### One type of product that’s more likely to contain lead are spices purchased abroad

We recommend that New Yorkers buy their spices locally in New York City, even if the spices are imported, rather than purchasing them abroad. 

A NYC Health Department study on spices collected during investigations between 2008 and 2017, including nearly 1,500 samples of spices from 41 countries, found that more than half of spice samples had detectable lead concentrations. About one-third of the samples had a lead level higher than 2 parts per million (ppm), the permissible limit in the U.S. for lead in food additives. 

Spices purchased abroad are more than 3 times as likely to exceed the permissible amount compared with spices purchased at stores in the US. Spices sold in stores in the US are subject to regulatory oversight, such as border control checks and surveillance by state and federal agencies, which likely decreases the chance of lead contamination in those products.

### It’s not just spices 

We have also investigated numerous cases of lead poisoning in children and adults associated with using:

Certain immigrant communities in NYC are at higher risk of lead exposure. For example, South Asians are more likely to have elevated blood lead levels compared to other NYC residents. In addition to lead paint and occupational lead hazards, poisonings in this community have been associated with using traditional consumer products. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10903-016-0403-5" target="_blank">Read more about lead poisoning and South Asians in NYC here.</a>

### Take steps to protect yourself and your family from lead exposure 

If you do construction, metal work, antique restoration or other work or hobbies that might bring you into contact with lead: 

* Use protective clothing and a proper respirator, and follow all safety protocols  
* Wash your hands and face before eating, drinking, or smoking  
* Avoid eating, drinking, or smoking in the work area 
* Wash your work clothing separately from household laundry 

<strong>Avoid consumer products that may contain lead.</strong> For more information, visit <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/lead-poisoning-hazardous-consumer-products.page">www.nyc.gov/hazardousproducts. </a>


If you think you or your family members are at risk for lead poisoning, <strong>ask your doctor for a blood lead test.</strong> Remind your provider to test your child for lead poisoning at ages 1 and 2 and ask about testing older children. If you need help finding a doctor, call 311.
