In Fall 2021, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority started work on [a Central Business District Tolling Program](https://new.mta.info/project/CBDTP), also known as congestion pricing. Through this plan, cars and trucks that enter Manhattan below 60th street - the central business district - would be charged a toll. By law, the toll money would fund important improvements to New York City’s transit system of subways, buses, and railroads. ([Read the law here](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/VAT/T8A44-C).)  

Traffic is a huge part of our environment in New York City, and it imposes a cost on every New Yorker. It affects our quality of life, our air quality, and the safety of walking, cycling, and other ways New Yorkers get around our city.

<em>Quick facts from <a href="https://new.mta.info/project/CBDTP/why-NYC-needs-central-business-district-tolling">mta.info</a>: 
<ul>
<li>Congestion in the New York City region will cost the city $100 billion over the next five years. 
<li>Every year, each New Yorker loses an average of 133 hours due to traffic - and nearly $1,900 in lost productivity and other costs. 
</ul>

By decreasing traffic density, congestion pricing could change our environment and improve our health. But its biggest promise lies in funding transit - modernizing our buses, subways, and trains. A strong transit system is the backbone of our city and contributes to our public health. Congestion pricing would fund more capacity, reliability, and accessibility, and expand the transit system into parts of NYC that are not currently served - providing a revolutionary investment in our city.  

## How can congestion pricing affect health? 
Though a minority of New Yorkers travel by car, car traffic is everywhere: a 2016 estimate found that in NYC, each square kilometer sees an average of 21.7 million miles of vehicular travel per year. Car travel is highest in Manhattan, with a borough average of 46,700,000 miles per square kilometer - that’s more than 110 million miles traveled per square mile.

In NYC, a neighborhood’s air quality is related to its traffic density, as well as its building emissions (especially the fuel used for heating) and density of restaurants and industrial areas.  

Air quality improves when traffic is reduced (read more at [air quality during COVID-19]() and [air quality in a car-free Times Square]()). However, the most significant health impacts of poor air quality are felt outside of the Central Business District. Ultimately, congestion pricing may not reduce traffic volume enough to result in cleaner air in [the neighborhoods that suffer the worst health impacts from air pollution]().

## Can lowering traffic volume affect street safety? 
In the central business district, fewer than 1 out of every 4 trips uses a car ([explore more data on modal use]()). That means that despite the ubiquity of car traffic, most New Yorkers don’t regularly use cars. In 2016, only about 40% of New Yorkers reported using a car in the past month. Twice as many walked or cycled for transportation in the same timeframe ([explore data here]()) This is good news for health! [Several studies show](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091743507004550) that more time walking and more time cycling are associated with [decreases in mortality](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11524-020-00510-1). 

Because so many New Yorkers are walkers and cyclists, many are concerned about traffic-related injuries - a preventable harm that affects too many New Yorkers each year ([explore data on pedestrian and bicycling injuries here]()). Traffic density is just one component of many environmental variables that can impact street safety - [we explored more of those here](). The streetscape can encourage or inhibit behaviors that keep us healthy ([explore neighborhood-level data on active design and physical activity here]()).  

Because the streetscape is such a huge part of the fabric of our city, it’s important to build a system for people, not just for cars: one that accommodates healthy movement and keeps people safe. Congestion pricing is one important piece of a people-focused transportation system.  

## Public transit is public health 

According the [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs), only 1 out of 4 NYC residents uses a car to commute. Most New Yorkers rely on our transit system – one of the oldest, largest, and most-used transit systems in the world. It moves millions of people per day - far more than private vehicles. The transit system is one of New York City’s crown jewels: its ability to move people around the city powers the economy and makes for a more equitable city.   

But transit’s benefits are more than economic: 

**Transit is good for your health**: access to transit increases opportunities for healthy regular physical activity, which translates directly to a healthier lifestyle. ([The City’s Active Design guidelines offer tools and strategies for ways to build opportunities for physical activity and health into our city](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/active-design.page).) 

**Transit is good for the climate**: taking the subway is one of the greenest ways to get around. [Greenhouse gas emissions]() (which we reduce when we use transit instead of cars) drive climate change, which is causing more frequent and more severe storms, extreme heat events, and other weather-related crises that threaten our city and its residents’ health today and in the future.   

**Transit is vital for an equitable city**: car-owning New Yorkers have an average income that’s [more than double](http://blog.tstc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/how-car-free-is-nyc.pdf) that of households that don’t own cars, so a strong transit system supports the working class.  At a neighborhood level, access to transit means access to economic opportunity and translates to lower unemployment - so expanding NYC’s transit network can help address long-term disinvestment in some NYC neighborhoods.  And, an equitable transit system must be accessible to all, [since 1 out of every 8 New York City residents has a mobility impairment]().

Congestion pricing will fund a crucial modernization to our transit system: through congestion pricing, the cost of vehicular traffic is converted into funding for transit, which benefits us all. By increasing transit options and capacity, our city can move more New Yorkers in the healthiest ways possible.  

## We need congestion pricing, because we need strong public transit

As our climate changes, it threatens our city, its infrastructure, and our health: in 2012, Superstorm Sandy showed us that a storm can damage our city’s transit system; this year, Hurricane Ida reminded us that powerful storms can be deadly. And [extreme heat kills more people in New York City than all other natural disasters combined]() ([explore the factors that affect heat vulnerability here]()).  

It’s never been more clear that a strong transit system and people-first, climate-focused transportation policy is the backbone of a healthy city. Congestion pricing’s biggest promise is an unprecedented investment in the healthiest, most efficient, and most beneficial ways to move people around the city. Congestion pricing will make New York City stronger and healthier and more equitable - and will benefit all its residents.
