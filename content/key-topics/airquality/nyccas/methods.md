        name: Fine Particles
        copy: >
            Fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) are tiny airborne solid and liquid
            particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter. It is small enough to
            penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, which can
            worsen lung and heart disease and lead to hospital admissions and
            premature deaths. PM<sub>2.5</sub> can either be directly emitted or
            formed in the atmosphere from other pollutants. Fuel combustion in
            vehicles, boilers in buildings, power plants, construction
            equipment, marine vessels and commercial cooking are all common
            sources of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Between 20% and 30% of the
            PM<sub>2.5</sub> in New York City's air comes from sources in areas
            upwind from the city, such as coal-burning power plants in the
            Midwest.

        name: Black Carbon
        copy: >
            Black carbon (BC) is one type of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and is the sooty
            black material emitted from gas and diesel engines, coal-fired power
            plants and other sources that burn fossil fuels. It comprises up to
            20% of fine particulate matter in New York City. Unlike other fine
            particles, BC is primarily from local sources. Inhalation of BC is
            associated with health problems, including respiratory and
            cardiovascular disease, cancer and birth defects. BC also
            contributes to climate change by altering the patterns of rain and
            clouds.

        name: Nitrogen Dioxide and Nitric Oxide
        copy: >
            Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and nitric oxide (NO) are part of
            a group of pollutants called "oxides of nitrogen" (NO<sub>X</sub>).
            Exposures to NO<sub>X</sub> are linked to increased emergency
            department visits and hospitalizations for respiratory conditions,
            particularly asthma. NO<sub>X</sub> also reacts with other compounds
            in the atmosphere to form PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone. A variety of
            combustion sources produce NO<sub>X</sub> in New York City,
            including motor vehicles, buildings, marine vessels and construction
            equipment.

        name: Ozone
        copy: >
            Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) occurs both in the Earth's upper atmosphere
            and at ground level. It forms at ground level when NO<sub>X</sub>
            emissions combine with sunlight and other airborne pollutants.
            Measured O<sub>3</sub> concentrations are often highest in the
            summer and downwind from areas with high NO<sub>X</sub> emissions,
            such as places with high traffic density. In areas with heavy
            traffic, NO<sub>X</sub> reacts with any ground-level O<sub>3</sub>
            to reduce O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. As a result, NYCCAS has
            measured lower O<sub>3</sub> levels near roadways, in city centers
            and in other areas of high NO<sub>X</sub> emissions density. Higher
            levels of O<sub>3</sub> are seen in areas away from dense traffic
            and building emissions.

        name: Sulfur Dioxide
        copy: >
            Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) is produced mainly by burning oils
            with high sulfur content, such as No. 4 and No. 6 oil (also known as
            residual fuel oil), or high-sulfur No. 2 oil. The primary use of
            fuel oil in NYC is to heat buildings and water, which is why we only
            monitor it in the winter. Some high-sulfur oil is also used to
            generate electricity and power marine vessels. SO<sub>2</sub>
            exposures can worsen lung diseases, causing hospitalizations and
            emergency department visits for asthma and other respiratory
            conditions. SO<sub>2</sub> also contributes to the formation of
            PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the atmosphere, resulting in PM<sub>2.5</sub>
            exposures downwind of SO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

The Health Department designed NYCCAS to understand how average air pollution levels vary from place to place within New York City. NYCCAS staff mount samplers on street light poles 10 to 12 feet off the ground along residential and commercial streets and in parks. The monitors use a small battery-powered pump and filters to collect air samples. Our air samplers are deployed at each NYCCAS site once each season and collect data for a two-week period. Samples are collected in all seasons for NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and BC; in the summer for O<sub>3</sub>; and in the winter for SO<sub>2</sub>. For more details on sample collection methods, see [Appendix 1 (PDF)](pdf/Appendix1.pdf).

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation also has a network of 19 air quality monitors in New York City that are required by the federal government, but they are mounted on building roofs. We placed our air samplers at street level to measure pollution where people spend time, and where traffic-related pollution levels are usually higher.

NYCCAS has also deployed eight monitors that can measure PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels in real time. These monitors allow us to monitor air pollution as it changes based on the time of day, weather or due to local pollution sources, such as heavy-duty trucks.
