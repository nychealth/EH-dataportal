    - Citywide, annual average levels of Black Carbon declined by 48% between
    2009 and 2022, an average of 0.05 micrograms per cubic meter per year. 

    - Across the 14-year period, higher levels were consistently seen near
    warehouses within industrial areas (reflecting increased truck traffic
    density) and in areas with higher nearby commercial cooking
    grills and charbroilers. 

    - In 2022, seasonal average BC concentrations across NYCCAS monitoring sites
    ranged from 0.21 to 1.8 micrograms per cubic meter.
'NO': >-
    - Citywide, annual average levels of Nitric Oxide declined by 58% between
    2009 and 2022, an average of 1.6 parts per billion per year. 

    - Across the 14-year period, higher levels were consistently seen at sites
    with higher nearby building density, emissions from overall traffic and from
    truck traffic related to warehouses.

    - In 2022, seasonal average NO concentrations across NYCCAS monitoring sites
    ranged from 2.8 to 58 ppb.
NO2: >-
    - Citywide, annual average levels of Nitrogen Dioxide declined by 41%
    between 2009 and 2022, an average of 0.84 parts per billion per year. 

    - Across the 14-year period, higher levels were consistently seen at sites
    with higher nearby building and traffic emissions. 

    - The persistence of building density as the most important indicator of
    NO<sub>2</sub> reflects the continued use of fossil fuel combustion for heat
    and hot water, even as fuels become cleaner and equipment more efficient. 

    - In 2022, seasonal average NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations across NYCCAS
    monitoring sites ranged from 5.3 to 33 ppb.    
PM: >-
    - Citywide, annual average levels of fine particulate matter declined by 46%
    between 2009 and 2022, an average of 0.4 micrograms per cubic meter per
    year.

    - Recently, higher levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> have been seen at sites with
    nearby commercial cooking grills and charbroilers and traffic emissions. This is
    largely due to buildings using cleaner fuels for heating and therefore
    emitting less PM<sub>2.5</sub> than when NYCCAS began monitoring.

    - In 2022, seasonal average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations across NYCCAS
    monitoring sites ranged from 2.6 to 21 micrograms per cubic meter.
O3: >-
    - Since the first summer (2009) when relatively cool temperatures
    contributed to lower levels of ozone, citywide summertime average levels
    varied slightly year to year (ranging from 27.8 ppb to 32 ppb between 2010
    and 2022), without a consistent trend.
    
    - Higher levels were consistently
    measured at sites with lower traffic density and lower NO<sub>2</sub>
    concentrations such as areas of outer Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island,
    reflecting less removal of ozone from the atmosphere by fresh combustion NO<sub>x</sub>
    emissions.
    
    - In summer 2022, seasonal average O<sub>3</sub> varied from 26.2
    to 39.7 ppb across the monitoring sites. Citywide, summertime ozone levels
    were higher than any other year. This was likely due to higher temperatures
    and low rainfall in 2022.
