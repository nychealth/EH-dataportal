The air quality in NYC is generally good and has been improving over time. But hour to hour, there is large variation in our air quality - even in neighborhoods with the cleanest air. That means that for short periods, some New Yorkers are exposed to high levels of pollutants.

Fine particles (PM2.5) are among the most harmful pollutants. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 contributes to an estimated 2,300 excess deaths from lung and heart disease each year in NYC (1 out of every 20 deaths in NYC), and short-term exposure contributes to asthma incidents severe enough to require a trip to the emergency department, as well as other health threats.

For PM2.5, NYC meets the national air quality standard of an annual average under {{< rawhtml >}}12 μg/m<sup>3</sup>{{< /rawhtml >}}, and a 24-hour average under {{< rawhtml >}}35 μg/m<sup>3</sup>{{< /rawhtml >}}. But hour-to-hour and location-by-location, PM2.5 levels vary dramatically and can spike to levels that could harm health, especially for sensitive populations. These higher levels are driven by daily changes in traffic volume, weather patterns that can trap emissions, and other short-term events.
