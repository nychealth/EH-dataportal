Injuries, both intentional — violence or suicide — and unintentional, dominate as causes of death among New Yorkers age 15 to 44. These premature deaths are tragic, unnecessary and preventable.

When we view them through the lense of environmental health, then we see that the risks, mitigation, and prevention strategies can be partly situated in our environment: analyzing these injuries by **means** (how they occur) makes an environmental argument that reducing access to the means of inflicting or experiencing these injuries can reduce the injuries themselves. 

Violence is an exceptional injury because it doesn’t just affect the immediate victim, but affects their surrounding community, too. Being exposedto violence is associated with worse birth outcomes, childhood developmental delays, physical and mental illness, and premature deaths. When we view violence as a public health issue - as a health harm that affects people - and shift the focus to the environmental contexts that are associated with violence, we have new opportunities to protect people's health.
