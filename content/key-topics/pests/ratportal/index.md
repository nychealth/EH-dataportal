## How to use the Rat Information Portal

Welcome to New York Cityâ€™s Rat Information Portal. This is a web-based mapping application that allows you to view rat inspection and action data collected by the NYC Health Department.

### Basic search
To get started, enter an address, zip code, neighborhood or Borough Block and Lot (BBL) in the search bar. You can also search by or zoom to a community board by turning on the toggle switch and selecting a Community Board from the drop-down menu. The map will re-center and zoom to that location.

### Selecting a property
After you have zoomed to your location, click on the property to get the inspection and action information.

### Information pop-up
Click on any property for the inspection and Health Department action information. A pop-up will show the latest inspection type and result, and the number of inspections the property received since 2015. Properties that have not been inspected in the last six months will appear gray on the map. You can still view their inspection and action history by clicking on the property. You can also access property history by clicking on Open Data and the results will open in a new tab.

You can refer to the Job ID in the pop-up for questions about a Health Department inspection or action.

For a full description of the inspection process and outcomes, see the FAQ.

### Printing and sharing
You can print and share the map.
