Climate, including extreme weather, has a direct impact on health. As NYC's climate changes, along with the world's climate, we expect more frequent and intense heat waves, increased rainfall and more severe storms. These will add to existing weather-related risks. Already, heat kills more people than all other natural disasters combined.

In New York City, those most vulnerable to the dangers of hot weather are older adults and people with health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive impairment - especially those in low-income, Black, and Brown communities. Air conditioning is the best defense against the heat. Equitable access and responsible use of air conditioning is crucial to protect the lives of all New Yorkers while reducing impacts on the environment.
