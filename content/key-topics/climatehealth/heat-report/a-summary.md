**Each summer, on average, an estimated 350 New Yorkers die prematurely because of hot weather in New York City (NYC).** 
These heat-related deaths account for about 2% of all deaths over the warm season months of May through September. Of the 350 deaths:
* From 2012-2021, there were an average of **7 heat-stress deaths** (caused directly by heat).
* From 2016-2020, there were an average of about **345 heat-exacerbated deaths** (caused indirectly by heat aggravating an underlying illness).

**Heat-exacerbated deaths have been increasing in the past decade**, mainly due to hotter summers overall with more “non-extreme hot days” of 82°F or up to but below the extreme heat threshold. &nbsp;

**Black New Yorkers are more likely to die from heat stress**, with death rates two times higher than White New Yorkers. This inequity is due to past and current structural racism that creates economic, health care, housing, energy, and other systems that benefit White people and disadvantage people of color. &nbsp;

**Lack of access to home air conditioning (AC) is an important risk factor for heat-stress death.** Among those who died from heat stress, the place of death was most often an un-air-conditioned home.

**NYC summers are getting hotter because of climate change.** 
Emergency response to extreme heat must be coupled with equitable investments in structural interventions and heat mitigation measures that reduce risk throughout the season. For example, New Yorkers will need energy efficient home cooling that they can afford to run, while tree planting and greening can help reduce local temperatures while providing shade.
