To describe the impact of climate change, we examined how the number of hot days during warm months changed over the past five decades (1971-2020) in rolling 5-year time windows. We also computed the average of daily maximum temperature for each month between May and September to examine if changes in temperature varied by month. 

Historically, the estimated impacts of heat, both extreme and non-extreme hot days, declined substantially between 1971 and 2000, plateaued after 2000, and then started increasing in the past decade (see Figure 3).

From 2016 to 2020, the most recent 5-year time window, the estimated annual average of heat-exacerbated deaths from May-September for all hot days was 345 (95% Confidence Interval \[95CI\]: 139, 549). Heat-exacerbated deaths make up approximately 2% of all natural-cause deaths in the warm months in this most recent period. Heat-exacerbated deaths at and above 82Â°F show an upward trend in the past decade (see Figure 3).

The estimated annual average of heat-exacerbated deaths associated with extreme heat events for 2016-2020 was 115 (95% CI: 50, 177). In contrast to the trend for both extreme and non-extreme hot days, heat-exacerbated deaths due to only extreme heat days are relatively constant over the past decade (see Figure 3).
