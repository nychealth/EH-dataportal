The NYC Health Department examined heat-stress deaths occurring during the warm season months of May through September from 2012-2021. We reviewed death certificates and medical examiner investigation reports in cases where heat was recognized as a cause of death. A more detailed description of methods and data sources can be found in the <a target="blank" href="Heat Mortality Methods 2023.pdf">Appendix Methods and Supplemental Data</a>

Among NYC residents, there were 68 heat-stress deaths over the 10-year period. There was an average of 7 deaths per year, with the largest yearly numbers of deaths occurring earlier in the period as a result of a severe heat wave in 2013. Most deaths occurred in July (68%), followed by June (13%), August (12%), September (4%), and May (3%). As of January 2023, there were 8 heat-stress deaths in 2022, though that number is provisional and subject to change because mortality records are not finalized.&nbsp;&nbsp;
