## Introduction

Hot weather is dangerous to health, sometimes resulting in death. Heat-related deaths are preventable. In this fourth annual report on heat-related mortality, the NYC Health Department reports on heat-related deaths in three ways:

* **Heat-stress deaths** (also called heat stroke deaths) are caused directly by heat and happen when heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and hyperthermia, lead to death. These deaths are coded as heat-related in death certificates, and cases can be counted and investigated.
* **Heat-exacerbated deaths** happen when heat worsens existing chronic conditions, such as heart disease. These deaths are caused indirectly by heat and are estimated using statistical models. They are also often called “excess” mortality.
* **Neighborhood impacts** are tracked by looking at community-level differences in risk of heat-related death and are described using the NYC Health Department’s Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI).

Starting last year, we report estimated trends in heat-exacerbated deaths for the current and past several decades (1972-2021) in five-year rolling time windows. For heat-stress deaths, we report counts and the annual average for the past ten years (2013-2022). Please refer to the footnote on years of data available \[hyperlink online\} for more information about the years of data included in this report.
