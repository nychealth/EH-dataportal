People who died from heat stress were most often exposed to dangerous heat in homes (58%, n= 37 of 64 records with detailed information available about onset place). Without AC, [indoor temperatures can be much higher than outdoors](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/99/12/bams-d-16-0280.1.xml), especially at night, and can continue for days after a heat wave \[2\].

Among New Yorkers exposed in homes, and for whom there was information about the presence or absence of an AC (n=24), none had or were using AC.

Among records with enough information to determine place of heat exposure (n=64), a third (n=18, 28%) of decedents were exposed outdoors, 8% (n=5) were exposed in parked cars, and 5% (n=3) were exposed indoors at worksites.

Overall, 9% (n=6) of deaths were work-related and another 9% (n=6) were individuals noted to be experiencing or suspected to be experiencing homelessness.
