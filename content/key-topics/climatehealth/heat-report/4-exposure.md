People who died from heat stress were most often exposed to dangerous heat in homes (60%, n= 35 of 58 records with detailed information available about onset place). Without AC,&nbsp;[indoor temperatures can be much higher than outdoors](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/99/12/bams-d-16-0280.1.xml), especially at night, and can continue for days after a heat wave \[2\].&nbsp; Among New Yorkers who were exposed in homes, and for whom there was information about the presence or absence of an AC, none had or were using AC. About a quarter (n=15, 26%) of decedents were exposed outdoors, 7% (n=4) were exposed in parked cars, and 5% (n=3) were exposed indoors at worksites. Overall, 10% (n=6) of deaths were work-related.

About a third (n=12, 34%) of people who were exposed to dangerous heat at home had an electric fan present and on, indicating that using an electric fan without an AC cannot always prevent death during extreme heat for people who are at highest heat risk.

Previous NYC Health Department studies have found that air conditioning access differs across race and class. Black New Yorkers and low-income New Yorkers are less likely to own or use an AC during hot weather, and the main reason is cost [\[3\]](https://nyccas.cityofnewyork.us/nyccas2022/report/1#References). While more than 90% of NYC households currently have air conditioning, access can be as low as 76% in neighborhoods where more people are living with limited financial resources.
