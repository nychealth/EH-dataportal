Given the consistently high and increasing proportion of hot days in July and August, heat-risk mitigation planning needs to emphasize non-emergency interventions, such as access to air conditioning. According to US Census Bureauâ€™s [American Housing Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs.html) and [Housing and Vacancy Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nychvs.html) conducted in New York City, air conditioning (AC) prevalence increased from about 40% in 1970 to over 80% by mid-2000 (Figure 7), likely explaining the reduction in estimated heat-exacerbated deaths in the corresponding period (Figure 3). However, the rate of increase in AC prevalence appears to have slowed since mid-2000 (Figure 7), as the number of hot days continued to increase, highlighting the urgency of achieving equitable cooling in the very near future.
