## Summary

* Each summer, on average, **an estimated 350 New Yorkers die prematurely because of hot weather** in New York City (NYC). These heat-related deaths account for about 2% of all deaths over the warm season months of May through September. Of the 350 deaths:
  * From 2012-2021, there were an average of 7 **heat-stress deaths** (caused directly by heat).
  * From 2016-2020, there were an average of about 345 **heat-exacerbated deaths** (caused indirectly by heat aggravating an underlying illness).
* **Heat-exacerbated deaths have been increasing in the past decade**, mainly due to hotter summers overall with more “non-extreme hot days” of 82°F or up to but below the extreme heat threshold. &nbsp;
* **Black New Yorkers are more likely to die from heat stress**, with death rates two times higher than White New Yorkers. This inequity is due to past and current structural racism that creates economic, health care, housing, energy, and other systems that benefit White people and disadvantage people of color. &nbsp;
* **Lack of access to home air conditioning (AC) is an important risk factor for heat-stress death.** Among those who died from heat stress, the place of death was most often an un-air-conditioned home.
* NYC summers are getting hotter because of climate change. **Emergency response to extreme heat must be coupled with equitable investments in structural interventions and heat mitigation measures that reduce risk throughout the season.** For example, New Yorkers will need energy efficient home cooling that they can afford to run, while tree planting and greening can help reduce local temperatures while providing shade.

## Introduction

Hot weather is dangerous to health, sometimes resulting in death. Heat-related deaths are preventable. In this third annual report on heat-related mortality, the NYC Health Department examined data from 2012-2021.

We track heat-related deaths in three ways:

* **Heat-stress deaths** (also called heat stroke deaths) are caused directly by heat and happen when heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and hyperthermia, lead to death. These deaths are coded as heat-related in death certificates, and cases can be counted and investigated.
* **Heat-exacerbated deaths** happen when heat worsens existing chronic conditions, such as heart disease. These deaths are caused indirectly by heat and are estimated using statistical models. They are also often called “excess” mortality.
* **Neighborhood impacts** are tracked by looking at community-level differences in risk of heat-related death and are described using the NYC Health Department’s Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI). HVI data inputs for income, race, and surface temperature were updated for this analysis. Data for neighborhood air conditioning prevalence and green space remains the same as last year’s report because updated data were not available.

Starting this year, we report estimated heat-exacerbated deaths for the current and past 20 years in five-year rolling time windows to look at trends. For heat-stress deaths (caused directly by heat), we report counts and the annual average for the past ten years. [Previous years' reports are available here.](#previous-reports)​
