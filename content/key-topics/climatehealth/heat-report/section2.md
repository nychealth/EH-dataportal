## Demographics

* Black New Yorkers have an age-adjusted death rate is that is twice as high as that of White New Yorkers (1.3 deaths per million compared with 0.6 deaths per million) from 2012-2021. This inequity is rooted in systemic racism \[1\]. Lack of equitable access to resources needed for wellness – for example, jobs that pay a living wage, affordable and healthy housing with air conditioning, and health care – are causes of these differences in heat-related mortality.&nbsp;
* Death rates were higher in neighborhoods with more residents living below the federal poverty line compared with wealthier neighborhoods.&nbsp;
* Heat-stress deaths occurred among all age groups, with the lowest rates among people aged 20 and younger and the highest among people aged 60 and older. &nbsp;
* About two thirds of heat-stress deaths occurred among men.&nbsp;
* Age-adjusted death rates were highest in Brooklyn.
