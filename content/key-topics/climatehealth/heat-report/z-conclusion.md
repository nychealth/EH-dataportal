## Conclusion

Heat contributes to the deaths of about 350 New Yorkers, on average, each year during the warm season of May through September. July accounts for the greatest share of heat-exacerbated deaths, and the average daily maximum temperature in July has increased by about 5°F in the past five decades. Deaths have been increasing over the past decade, likely due to both increasing temperatures and lagging access to home AC, particularly in communities most burdened by heat-health impacts.

To prepare for a hotter future and prevent heat-related deaths, the City needs long-lasting, structural interventions alongside emergency preparedness and response. Adapting to a hotter climate means the City must:

* Ensure equitable access to life-saving residential cooling for all New Yorkers.
  * Implement maximum temperature regulations during the summer months for tenants as laid out in 2023 [PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done](https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/planyc-getting-sustainability-done/).
  * Explore mandates on property owners to provide tenants with AC without additional surcharges.
  * Help eligible residents apply for a free air conditioner with installation through the Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP)’s [Cooling Assistance Component](https://otda.ny.gov/programs/heap/#cooling-assistance).
* Make summertime utility costs affordable for low- and middle-income New Yorkers so they can use AC to protect themselves from the heat.
  * Expand HEAP Cooling Assistance Component benefits to include summer utility costs.&nbsp;
  * Prohibit electricity disconnections during hot weather, even if bills are unpaid.
  * Make energy prices affordable for all New Yorkers through affordable energy rates for low- and middle-income customers.&nbsp;
  * Fund energy efficient home improvements to help reduce family energy costs and decrease pressure on the electrical grid.
  * Protect the electrical grid, including by discouraging excess cooling in offices and commercial establishments.
* Invest in hyper-local resiliency to make all NYC neighborhoods cooler and safer.
  * Implementing green infrastructure projects, especially in high HVI neighborhoods, including planting trees and other greenery and expanding cool roofs.&nbsp;
  * Support community-based organizations (CBO) working to reduce the health impacts of climate change.
  * Include CBOs and residents in decision-making about and investments in community infrastructure and public space.
  * Fund and provide technical assistance for programs — such as the NYC Health Department’s Be a Buddy — that support CBOs to build community resilience through social cohesion and access to physical and mental health resources that can help people stay safe in the heat.&nbsp;
  * Continue to strengthen emergency response during extreme heat, such as opening cooling centers and issuing heat-health warnings, prioritizing people and communities with the greatest need.

<div class="fs-sm px-2 py-1 mb-2"><strong>Note on years of data included:</strong> For heat-stress, data for 2021 and 2022 are considered preliminary because death data are still being compiled by the Bureau of Vital Statistics. These numbers may be updated in future reports as final data become available; 2021 heat-stress numbers are less likely to change. All heat-stress tables are based on heat-stress deaths from 2012-2021. The heat-exacerbated mortality analysis requires complete daily death counts to produce accurate estimates, making 2020 the most recent available year of data.</div>
