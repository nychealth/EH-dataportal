* Black New Yorkers continue to have an age-adjusted heat-stress death rate that twice as high as that of White New Yorkers (1.2 deaths per million compared with 0.5 deaths per million) from 2013-2022. This inequity is rooted in systemic racism \[1\]. Lack of equitable access to resources – for example, jobs that pay a living wage, affordable and healthy housing with air conditioning, and health care – are causes of these differences in heat-related mortality.
* Death rates were higher in neighborhoods with more residents living below the federal poverty line compared with wealthier neighborhoods.
* Heat-stress deaths occurred among all age groups, with the lowest rates among people aged 20 and younger and the highest among people aged 60 and older.
* Rates of heat-stress deaths were higher among males compared to females.
* Age-adjusted death rates were highest in Brooklyn.
