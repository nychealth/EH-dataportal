The Health Department inspects the approximately 27,000 restaurants in New York City to monitor their compliance with food safety regulations. Inspectors observe how food is prepared, served and stored and whether restaurant workers are practicing good hygiene. They check food temperatures, equipment maintenance and pest control measures.

Violations found during inspections carry point values, and a restaurantâ€™s score corresponds to a letter grade:
- "A" grade: 0 to 13 points for sanitary violations
- "B" grade: 14 to 27 points for sanitary violations
- "C" grade: 28 or more points for sanitary violations

**See below for the conditions that health inspectors look for, and the violation points they carry.**

"Condition" refers to the number, magnitude, pervasiveness, or seriousness of risk presented by a violation. [For details or examples of violation conditions, see Appendix 23-B, "A guide to conditions."](inspection-procedures.pdf)

"Grade Pending" means that on both the initial inspection and reinspection, the restaurant received 14 or more points. Following the reinspection, the restaurant can post "Grade Pending" or the letter grade while they have the opportunity for an administrative hearing to determine the final grade.
