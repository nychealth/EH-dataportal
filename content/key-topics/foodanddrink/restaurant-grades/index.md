The Health Department inspects the approximately 27,000 restaurants in New York City to monitor their compliance with food safety regulations. Inspectors observe how food is prepared, served and stored and whether restaurant workers are practicing good hygiene. They check food temperatures, equipment maintenance and pest control measures.

Over time, more restaurants have achieved A grades. This means that the grading system has helped restaurants become cleaner, safer, healthier places to eat. That's good news for all New Yorkers.
