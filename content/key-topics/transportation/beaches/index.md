## FAQ
Q: How does the NYC Health Department monitor and sample beaches?
A: The Health Department begins to monitor and sample beaches one month before they open to the public. Each beach is monitored and sampled every week, except for Rockaway and Breezy Point beaches, which are sampled bi-weekly. Monitoring identifies sources of pollution that can affect beach water quality, and sampling provides data about current water quality conditions.

Q: How is beach water quality determined?
A: Water samples are tested for contaminants that lower water quality. These include:
- Bacteria
- Floatable debris
- Animal waste
- Medical or infectious waste
- Toxic contaminants
- Petroleum products
- Sewage and wastewater discharge following heavy rainfall

Q: When is a water quality warning/advisory issued?
A: When water has high levels of bacteria, the Health Department issues an advisory. This means swimming and wading are not recommended, but the beach is open.

An advisory may be issued based on:
- Water quality concerns
- Presence of:
- Floatable debris
- Medical or infectious waste
- Toxic contaminants
- Petroleum products
- Other contamination
- Sewage and wastewater discharge following heavy rainfall

Q: When is a beach closed?
A: City beaches may be closed for swimming and wading when:
- Samples show that beach water quality does not meet established standards
- There have been a high number of illnesses or complaints about illness or injury.
- There are hazardous amounts of:
    - Floatable debris
    - Medical or infectious waste
    - Toxic contaminants
    - Petroleum products
- Sewage and wastewater discharge have lowered the water quality.

Any other environmental factors that may be a public health or safety hazard, such as extreme weather conditions.

Though swimming and wading is not permitted, exercise, such as walking and running, and spending time on the sand and boardwalk, are permitted during regular park hours.

    - Wait...
    - Trash Free Waters
