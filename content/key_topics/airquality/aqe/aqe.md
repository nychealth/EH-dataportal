We combine data from our air quality monitoring network, NYCCAS, with other data to understand what makes one neighborhood's air quality different from another's. We found that building emissions, building density, industrial areas, and traffic density are associated with differences in air quality.

If we don't have an air quality monitor in one neighborhood, but we know its building density, its industrial area, and its traffic, then we can model (estimate or predict) its air quality - based on monitored air quality in similar neighborhoods.
