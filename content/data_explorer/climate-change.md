# Climate Change
### About Climate Change


There is broad consensus within the scientific community that human activity is changing the Earth's climate through **increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs)** — primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) — in the atmosphere.


Scientists have predicted that unless GHG emissions are substantially stemmed by the end of the century, climate change will become irreversible.


A key part of combating climate change is mitigation, which means **reducing GHG emissions**. Because the New York City emits nearly 0.25% of the world's total GHGs, decreasing our emissions and becoming more efficient will have a positive impact.


### Climate Change and Health


Climate change can affect human health in many ways. For NYC, the two main climate change-related health risks are **heat stress** from increased number and intensity of heat waves, and **health impacts from coastal storms**. These impacts can affect the health of all New Yorkers. 


### To Reduce Health Risks


NYC has been responding to climate change and is working to improve the city's resilience against future climate change. To help reduce health risks related to climate change, you can:


* **Support policies that reduce GHGs**, including improving public transportation, reducing waste, promoting energy efficiency and producing food and consumer goods locally.
* **Join a community group that focuses on climate change**, and create or participate in community-based action plans that reduce health risks such as using buddy systems during [heat waves](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/emergency-preparedness/emergencies-extreme-weather-heat.page "Extreme heat and your health").
