# Asthma
### About Asthma


Asthma is a **common disease in which the lungs become swollen, making breathing difficult**. Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and tightness in the chest. The exact causes of asthma are not known. **Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be controlled**.


Asthma is a leading cause of emergency room visits, hospitalizations and missed school days in New York City's poorest neighborhoods. In NYC, asthma is more common among **low-income Black and Latino children**. 


### Asthma and the Environment


Certain things in the environment can trigger an asthma attack or make symptoms worse. **Common triggers include**: 


* **Tobacco smoke**
* **Air pollution**, such as particulates, ozone and diesel exhaust
* **Dust mites, cockroaches and mold**
* **Pollen**
* **Pets**


Download the [Asthma and Environment Neighborhood Report](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/QuickView.aspx) on this website to see how your neighborhood compares to others. 


### Controlling Asthma


Asthma does not have to prevent you from leading an active and healthy life. You can take charge by having **a plan to control asthma**, including these strategies for avoiding asthma triggers:


* **Check the weather report daily for air pollution level** ("air quality index") and pollen counts. Limit time outside when air pollution levels or pollen counts are high.
* **If you smoke, [quit](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/smoking-how-to-quit.page "NYC Quits")**. Don't allow smoking in your home or car.
* Remove clutter and clean regularly to **reduce dust levels in your home**.
* Work with your landlord to fix leaks promptly to **prevent mold**. If your landlord fails to fix the problem, call 311.
* Do not allow furry pets on the furniture or in the bedroom.
* **[Pest proof your home](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/pests-and-pesticides.page).** If building conditions may be attracting pests, contact your landlord. If your landlord does not addres your concerns, call 311.
