### About Cancer


Cancer is the general name for a group of more than 100 diseases in which cells in a part of the body begin to grow out of control. Cancers are named for the organ or type of cell in which they start.


Cancer occurs at all ages, but the risk increases with age. One of every two men, and one of every three women, will be diagnosed with cancer at some time in their life. In women, breast is the most common type of cancer diagnosed. In men, prostate is the most common type of cancer diagnosed. For both men and women, lung cancers are the leading causes of death from cancer.


In New York City cancer kills nearly 13,000 residents every year, with smoking as the leading cause. Most cancers develop slowly in people. Cancers with known environmental causes usually appear five to 40 years after exposure to a [carcinogen](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Carcinogen). This long [latency period](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Latency_period) is one of the reasons it is difficult to determine what causes cancer.


The data on this site comes from the [NYS Cancer Registry](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#NYS_Cancer_Registry).


### Cancer and the Environment


Cancers have different causes and risk factors. Factors related to the occurrence of many types of cancer include age, sex, race, family history, smoking, diet, exercise and exposure to certain chemicals. Cancers often take a long time (decades) to develop, so it can be hard to single out a particular exposure as having a definite link to cancer.  
  
Environmental exposures that may increase the risk of cancer include asbestos and other inhalable fibers; ionizing radiation and chemicals found in the home, workplace, water, food and air.


### About the Data and Indicators


Data are reported over five-year time periods because the number of cases and rates for single years can vary considerably, particularly for less common types of cancer.  
  
All cancers diagnosed among NYS residents are required by law to be reported to the NYS Cancer Registry. The registry is considered to have 95% or higher case ascertainment.  
  
This site contains data on tobacco-related cancers of the mouth and throat area ([larynx](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Larynx_Cancer),  [esophagus](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Esophagus_Cancer), oral cavity, and pharynx), cancers of the breast, lung and bronchus, pancreas, mesothelioma – a cancer associated with exposure to asbestos, bladder, brain and central nervous system, thyroid, kidney, liver, [Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Non_Hodgkin_lymphoma) [leukemia](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Leukemia) and [melanoma](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Glossary.aspx#Melanoma) skin cancer. These cancers were selected based on concern that environmental exposures could play a role in their development.


### Prevention


To reduce the risk of developing cancer or to detect cancer early:


* Quit smoking and encourage others to quit. Avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.
* Practice good nutrition (eating at least five servings of fresh fruit and vegetables daily).
* Support policies that increase access to healthy food and safe physical activity.
* Exercise regularly and maintain a healthy weight.
* Encourage or provide a work environment that supports physical activity by providing bike rooms and showers.
* Avoid use of and exposures to carcinogenic chemicals in the workplace.
* Use sun protection consistently to prevent skin cancers.


Detecting cancer early saves lives. Get screened at appropriate ages for cervical, breast and colon and rectal cancer.
