# Overweight
### About Weight and Health


People who are overweight or obese are at increased risk for heart disease and diabetes. Physical activity and healthy eating can promote well-being and relieve stress.


### Weight and the Environment


Neighborhood conditions and resources can encourage or discourage healthy behaviors. The density and types of food retail outlets available in neighborhoods may affect food shopping habits and nutrition choices of residents. Healthy food choices combined with physically active lifestyle support maintenance of an optimal bodyweight and overall good health.


### About the Data and Indicators


Weight indicators presented on this site are derived from the biennial NYC Youth Risk Behavior Survey and the annual Community Health Survey. They are estimates that depend on study participants' accurate recollections and reporting.


### Health Promotion Strategies


Maintain good nutrition habits, including:


* Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.
* Watch your portions
* Eat whole grains
* Drink very low calorie beverages, like water and unsweetened tea. Avoid sugary drinks.
* Keep to recommended calorie levels for your age, gender, weight and physical activity level.


### Key Messages


More than half of adult New Yorkers are either overweight or obese. Being at an unhealthy weight increases a person's risk of developing many conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cancer and heart disease.


Poor neighborhoods have higher rates of obesity and related deaths due to diabetes and heart disease than more affluent neighborhoods.
