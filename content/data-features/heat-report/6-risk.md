Our updated analyses of heat-exacerbated deaths confirmed the continued elevated risk of dying at home, as well as higher odds of death among Black New Yorkers compared with other groups.

In previous analyses, heat-exacerbated deaths occurring at home increased during and shortly after extreme heat events (i.e., at or above the NYC heat advisory threshold), and Black New Yorkers had higher odds of death compared to other New Yorkers during the years 2000-2011[\[5\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4492264/). We repeated this case-only analysis with recent data (May – September 2012-2021). We also examined at-home deaths (approximately 28 percent of all deaths during the study period) to see how the proportion of at-home deaths changes by temperature across the entire warm season temperature range. For this analysis, we used five temperature ranges (quintiles of the average of the same day through the previous 3 days daily maximum temperature). [See the Appendix Methods and Supplemental Data for more information](2024-Heat-Mortality-Report-Appendix.pdf).

We again found elevated risk of heat-related death at home and for Black New Yorkers. The estimated risk for at-home deaths and for Black New Yorkers for extreme heat days for 2012-2021 was the same, with an odds ratio of 1.06 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.11). Figure 5 shows the odds ratios of the at-home deaths as a function of the five temperature ranges with days less than 74°F as the reference. Although the odds ratio — the proportion of at-home deaths relative to that for days with daily maximum temperature less than 74°F — was highest for the hottest temperature range (&gt;86°F), the other temperature ranges also show elevated odds ratios. This suggests that the risk of dying at home increases as the temperature increases - both at hot and extreme temperatures.

In addition, at-home risk was elevated across racial and ethnic groups, with a higher proportion of at-home deaths for non-Hispanic White, Black, and Hispanic New Yorkers at the hottest temperatures (Figure 6). The number of deaths for Asian decedents — about eight percent of all deaths — and decedents of other race and ethnicities were too small to estimate results with precision.

These results further underscore the importance of at-home cooling, irrespective of race and ethnicity.
