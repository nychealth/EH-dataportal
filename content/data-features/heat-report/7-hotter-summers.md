The five average temperature range categories (of 0-3 days average of daily maximum temperature) used in the analysis above each account for approximately 20% of days in the warm months (May through September) during 2012-2021. Due to climate change, however, the proportion of the number of days that fall into the higher temperature range has been increasing. Figure 7 shows the average number of days over running 10-year time windows for each of the five temperature ranges since 1972.

* The number of days in the two cooler temperature ranges (&lt;74°F and 74-79°F) have been declining, whereas the number of days in the two hotter temperature ranges (84-86°F and &gt;86°F) have been increasing. In particular, the number of days for the hottest temperature range (&gt;86°F) more than doubled—from 14 to 32 days per summer on average—over the five decades with a steadily increasing trend.
* The measurable and significant rise in hot summer days highlights the urgency for the city to achieve universal access to at-home cooling, combined with equitable access to affordable energy for low-income households to ensure safe indoor thermal environments for the even hotter summers anticipated in the coming decades.
