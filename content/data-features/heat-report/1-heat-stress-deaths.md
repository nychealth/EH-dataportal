The NYC Health Department examined heat-stress deaths occurring during the warm season months of May through September from 2013-2022. We reviewed death certificates and medical examiner investigation reports in cases where heat was recognized as a cause of death. [A more detailed description of methods and data sources can be found in the Appendix Methods and Supplemental Data](2024-Heat-Mortality-Report-Appendix.pdf).

Among NYC residents, there were 69 heat-stress deaths over the 10-year period. There was an average of 7 deaths per year, with the largest yearly numbers of deaths occurring earlier in the period as a result of a severe heat wave in 2013. Most deaths occurred in July (72%), followed August (12%), June (7%), September (4%), and May (4%). As of January 2024, there were 5 heat-stress deaths in 2023, though that number is provisional and subject to change because mortality records are not yet finalized.
