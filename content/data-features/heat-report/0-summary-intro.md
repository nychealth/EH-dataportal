Each summer, on average, **an estimated 350 New Yorkers die prematurely because of hot weather** in New York City (NYC). These heat-related deaths account for about 2% of all deaths over the warm season months of May through September. Of the 350 deaths:

* There were an average of **7 heat-stress deaths** (caused directly by heat) per year.
* There were an average of about **338 heat-exacerbated deaths** (caused indirectly by heat aggravating an underlying illness) per year.

**Heat-exacerbated deaths increased in the past decade**, mainly due to hotter summers overall with more “non-extreme hot days” of 82°F up to but below the extreme heat threshold (95°F). Death counts have remained steady in the most recent years.

**Black New Yorkers are more likely to die from heat stress**, with death rates two times higher than White New Yorkers. Black New Yorkers also have a higher likelihood of heat-exacerbated death compared to other New Yorkers. This inequity is due to past and current structural racism that creates economic, health care, housing, energy, and other systems that benefit White people and disadvantage people of color.

**Lack of access to home air conditioning (AC) is the most important risk factor for heat-stress death**. Among those who died from heat stress, the place of death was most often an un-air-conditioned home. Heat-exacerbated deaths were also more likely to occur at home, underscoring the importance of access to cooling at home.

NYC summers are getting hotter because of climate change. **Emergency response to extreme heat must be coupled with equitable investments in structural interventions and heat mitigation measures that reduce risk throughout the season**. For example, all New Yorkers will need energy efficient home cooling that they can afford to run, and tree planting and greening can help reduce local temperatures while providing shade.

## Introduction

Hot weather is dangerous to health, sometimes resulting in death. Heat-related deaths are preventable. In this fourth annual report on heat-related mortality, the NYC Health Department reports on heat-related deaths in three ways:

* **Heat-stress deaths** (also called heat stroke deaths) are caused directly by heat and happen when heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and hyperthermia, lead to death. These deaths are coded as heat-related in death certificates, and cases can be counted and investigated.
* **Heat-exacerbated deaths** happen when heat worsens existing chronic conditions, such as heart disease. These deaths are caused indirectly by heat and are estimated using statistical models. They are also often called “excess” mortality.
* **Neighborhood impacts** are tracked by looking at community-level differences in risk of heat-related death and are described using the NYC Health Department’s Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI).

Starting last year, we report estimated trends in heat-exacerbated deaths for the current and past several decades (1972-2021) in five-year rolling time windows. For heat-stress deaths, we report counts and the annual average for the past ten years (2013-2022).
