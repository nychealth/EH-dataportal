Deaths from chronic conditions that are not recognized as heat-related on death certificates can be estimated using statistical models. There are many more of these deaths than those from heat stress. They are called “excess deaths” or “heat-exacerbated deaths.” Unlike heat-stress deaths, which can be individually identified and investigated, excess deaths can be estimated only as aggregate counts. However, estimating heat-exacerbated deaths — or “mortality” — better captures the true extent of how many New Yorkers are dying due to heat.

We report estimated heat-exacerbated deaths for the current and historical data in five-year rolling time windows to characterize trends. The average natural death count per year was about 18,000 for May through September for the most recent 5-year period (2017-2021). We used time-series statistical models to compare deaths on hot days with those on cooler days. We estimated heat-exacerbated deaths using:

* An indicator (yes/no) for extreme heat event days defined by the National Weather Service’s heat advisory levels for NYC. Based on the NYC Health Department’s previous analysis of heat-exacerbated mortality, heat advisories are for at least 2 consecutive days with 95°F or higher daily maximum heat index (HI) or any day with a maximum HI of 100°F or higher.
* A range of hot daily maximum temperatures that includes both extreme heat event days and other hot days. We estimated heat-exacerbated deaths for days ranging from the median maximum daily temperature of 82°F through the highest temperature during the period.

These models were run in 5-year rolling time windows between 1972 and 2021 (last year’s report included 1971 to 2020). We included deaths occurring on the date of exposure to hot weather and over the following 3 days because previous NYC Health Department studies have shown that heat-exacerbated deaths can occur up to 3 days after the initial hot weather [\[4\]](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.0900906). [Detailed methods used to estimate risks and attributable deaths can be found in the Appendix Methods and Supplemental Data](2024-Heat-Mortality-Report-Appendix.pdf).

Estimated heat-exacerbated deaths — both those attributed to extreme and non-extreme hot days — declined substantially between 1972 and 2000 and plateaued after 2000 for about a decade (see Figure 3). Heat-exacerbated deaths at and above 82°F started increasing about a decade ago but plateaued in recent years (see Figure 3).

From 2017 to 2021, the most recent 5-year time window, the estimated annual average of heat-exacerbated deaths during May-September for all hot days was 338 (95% Confidence Interval \[95% CI\]: 140, 522). Heat-exacerbated deaths made up approximately 2% of all natural-cause deaths in the warm months in this most recent period.

The estimated annual average of heat-exacerbated deaths due to extreme heat events for 2017-2021 was 98 (95% CI: 34, 157). In contrast to the trend for both extreme and non-extreme hot days, heat-exacerbated deaths due to only extreme heat days are relatively constant over the past decade (see Figure 3).

Heat-exacerbated mortality risks were observed across the full range of hot days (maximum temperature at or above 82°F) during warm season months. Risk increased with temperature, with the largest increases occurring at the highest temperatures, and a steeper slope of relative risk above 90°F (see Figure 4). Note that, because there are more days in the range of non-extreme hot days (i.e., 82-94°F) than those in the extreme heat days (95+°F; see the histogram below the relative risk curve), these non-extreme hot days contribute more to the total heat-exacerbated deaths than the days in the extreme heat range.
