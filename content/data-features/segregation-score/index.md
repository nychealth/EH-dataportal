**Measuring disparities with the 'index of concentration at the extremes'**

It’s widely known that in New York City (as elsewhere), people with lower socio-economic status bear a higher burden of poor health and premature death.  

Since 2011, the Health Department has routinely analyzed health data in conjunction with data on neighborhood poverty. However, another measure does a better job of capturing health disparities – and illustrating how both economic and racial/ethnic inequality contribute to differences in who’s healthy and who gets sick in New York City. 

This Segregation Score is calculated using the ‘index of concentration at the extremes’ (or ICE). It shows us areas of <span style="font-weight:bold; color: purple">concentrated privilege</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold; color: orange">concentrated deprivation</span>.
