Since monitoring began in winter 2008-2009 in New York City, we have seen a decrease in most of the air pollutants we measure. However, the concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub>, NO and PM<sub>2.5</sub> continue to be higher in industrial zones with more diesel truck traffic, neighborhoods with large numbers of restaurants, and areas of higher traffic and building density.

Air pollution changes not only by neighborhood, but also by season. Some pollutants are highest in certain seasons of the year because of either weather patterns or emissions sources. For example, O<sub>3</sub> is produced when NO and NO<sub>2</sub> and other airborne pollutants react in the presence of heat and sunlight. Therefore, we only monitor O<sub>3</sub> in the summer when direct sunlight is highest and days are longer.

The figure below illustrates how the levels of each air pollutant change by season from winter 2008-2009 to fall 2022. We compare trends among locations with high, medium and low densities of the most common sources of each pollutant.
