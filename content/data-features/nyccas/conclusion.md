This report underscores the importance of local emissions reduction efforts over the past decade and highlights the continued need to reduce emissions citywide. The Cityâ€™s sustainability plan, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/planyc-getting-sustainability-done/">PlaNYC</a>, and its [roadmap to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 80x50](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/sustainability/downloads/pdf/publications/New%20York%20City's%20Roadmap%20to%2080%20x%2050_Final.pdf), have already and will continue to improve air quality, providing important public health benefits to all New Yorkers. These strategies and measures include:

* Reducing emissions from commercial charbroiling through regulations and technical support to restaurants
* Creating low or zero emission freight networks and reducing reliance on trucks
* Improving and expanding public transit
* Getting the most polluting trucks off New York City streets
* Accelerating the phase-out of fossil fuel combustion in buildings, focusing on the communities most impacted by air pollution related health impacts

Air quality in New York City has greatly improved over the past decade and will continue to improve with efforts to control emissions from the most important sources.
