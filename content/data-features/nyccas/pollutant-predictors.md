NYCCAS data were analyzed using a model that estimates associations among pollution levels and land uses, like traffic and zoning, around the monitoring sites. The pollution sources that contribute most to differences in concentrations of NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, BC, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> across NYC are listed in the table below. SO<sub>2</sub> is now so low in NYC that it has not been possible to build a model for SO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>concentrations since 2018.

Fuel used to provide heat and hot water in buildings has become significantly cleaner under state and local regulations requiring use of cleaner burning fuels. As a result, commercial charbroiling and grilling operations have become a more important source of PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions over the past several years. The number of charbroilers and grills in restaurants in an area now explains PM<sub>2.5</sub> and BC differences among neighborhoods better than building emissions.
