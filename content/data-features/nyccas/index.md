## NYCCAS Report: 2008-2022

In 2007, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Health Department) established the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS), the largest ongoing urban air monitoring program of any U.S. city. NYCCAS, which began collecting data in December 2008, is a collaboration between the Health Department and Queens College of the City University of New York and provides data to:

* Help inform PlaNYC, the City’s sustainability plan
* Track changes in air quality over time
* Estimate exposures for health research
* Inform the public about local topics, such as [recent air quality improvements](../../../data-stories/breatheeasy/), [car-free zones](../../../data-stories/aqts/), [changes in the sources of air pollution](../../../data-stories/aq-cooking/), [unique air quality studies conducted in New York City](../../../data-stories/aqsnapshots/), [efforts to reduce health impacts](../../../data-stories/hia/) and [differences in air quality and related health impacts across NYC neighborhoods](../../../data-stories/aq2/). NYCCAS also developed [a tool (ZAPPA) that can help people understand how policy changes can change local emissions](../../../data-stories/zappa/).

This report:

* Provides a summary of key findings, the air monitoring program, monitoring site selection, and descriptions of the pollutants measured
* Describes the trends in air pollutant levels from more than a decade of data from winter 2008-2009 through fall 2022 for fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, black carbon, wintertime sulfur dioxide and summertime ozone
* Presents maps of neighborhood air pollution levels by year
* Identifies the local sources that contribute to high levels of these pollutants in New York City neighborhoods

### Key Findings

**Citywide, annual average levels of four key pollutants have gone down between the first year of monitoring, 2009, and the most recent year of data, 2022.**

* Fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-46%
* Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; -41%
* Nitric Oxide (NO)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -58%
* Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -97%

**Air quality improved significantly after local regulations required building owners to convert to cleaner heating oils by 2015.** These heating oils were a major source of SO<sub>2</sub> in New York City. In 2022, only eight of our 90 sites detected any SO<sub>2</sub>, and the levels at those sites were similar to SO<sub>2</sub> levels measured on Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondack Mountains, demonstrating the success of the clean heating oil requirements.

**Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) levels were higher in 2022 than any previous year of NYCCAS monitoring.** Ozone is produced when there are oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>) and volatile organic carbon emissions in the presence of sunlight and heat, which is why we see higher levels in the summer. Summer 2022 was one of the hottest and driest in recorded history, likely causing higher O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;levels.

There has not been a consistent trend in O<sub>3</sub> levels over the history of NYCCAS monitoring, but we may expect O<sub>3</sub> levels to trend higher in the future with further increases in average temperatures due to climate change.

**Air quality changes with location.**

PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, and black carbon (BC) are highest in:

* Areas with higher density of commercial cooking grills and charbroilers
* Industrial areas, specifically areas with higher density of warehouses
* Areas of higher traffic density
* Areas with higher building density

O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;levels are highest in:

* Areas with lower vehicle emissions
