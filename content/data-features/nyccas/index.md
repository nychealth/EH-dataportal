    style="width:50%;" class="my-2 pl-2"> <p>Since it is impossible to sample
    the air in every location in New York City, we monitor representative sites
    to determine how pollution levels vary in relation to traffic, buildings,
    trees and other neighborhood factors. We use NYCCAS monitoring data along
    with data on land use, traffic, building emissions and other neighborhood
    factors around the monitors to build a land-use regression (LUR) model. We
    then use the associations from these models to estimate the seasonal average
    air pollution levels at locations across the city, including places where no
    NYCCAS measurements were collected. For more details on emission source
    data, see <a href="Appendix1.pdf">Appendix 1 (PDF)</a>. For more details on
    the analysis methods, see <a
    href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-publications/air-quality-nyc-community-air-survey.page#nyccas-pubs">NYCCAS
    Scientific Publications</a>.</p> <p>In the maps below, you can select a
    pollutant to see how air pollution is distributed throughout the city and
    how it has changed over time. The city’s air quality has changed
    significantly since NYCCAS began monitoring, as can be seen in the maps
    below. The levels of BC, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, SO<sub>2</sub> and
    PM<sub>2.5</sub> have been significantly reduced citywide. The areas where
    we see the highest levels of these pollutants has also shifted.</p> <p>Over
    time, there are better data available for us to understand the relationships
    between land use and pollution, and the air pollution patterns have shifted as
    the city changes. Although industrial land use has been a primary
    indicator of BC, NO, NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution in the
    past, in the most recent years of data we see evidence that the density of
    warehouses with loading docks better explains the difference in pollution
    levels between neighborhoods.  Areas with a higher density of warehouses,
    such as Newtown Creek area in Queens and Brooklyn, near JFK airport, Sunset
    Park in Brooklyn and Hunts Point in the Bronx, have higher levels of
    pollution.</p> <p>

    There have been too few sites with SO<sub>2</sub> values above the detection
    limit for us to include data after winter 2017-2018 in these maps and
    charts. SO<sub>2</sub> levels have gone down dramatically since  <a

    Law 43 of 2010 prohibited the burning of heavy fuel oil (No. 6) in New York
    City buildings (PDF)</a>. Historical maps for SO<sub>2</sub> and other
    pollutants are available by clicking on the “All years” button below.</p>

pollutantTrends: >-
    <p>Since monitoring began in winter 2008-2009 in New York City, we have seen
    a decrease in most of the air pollutants we measure. However, the
    concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub>, NO and PM<sub>2.5</sub> continue to be
    higher in industrial zones with more diesel truck traffic, neighborhoods
    with large numbers of restaurants, and areas of higher traffic and building
    density. </p>

    <p>Air pollution changes not only by neighborhood, but also by season. Some
    pollutants are highest in certain seasons of the year because of either
    weather patterns or emissions sources. For example, O<sub>3</sub> is
    produced when NO and NO<sub>2</sub> and other airborne pollutants react in the
    presence of heat and sunlight. Therefore, we only monitor O<sub>3</sub> in
    the summer when direct sunlight is highest and days are longer.</p><p>The
    figure below illustrates how the levels of each air pollutant change by
    season from winter 2008-2009 to fall 2021. We compare trends among locations
    with high, medium and low densities of the most common sources of each
    pollutant.</p>
conclusion: >-
    <p>This report underscores the importance of emissions reduction efforts
    over the past decade and highlights the continued need to reduce emissions
    citywide. The City’s sustainability plan, PlaNYC, and its roadmap to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions, <a
    href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/sustainability/downloads/pdf/publications/New
    York City's Roadmap to 80 x 50_Final.pdf">80x50</a>, have already and will
    continue to improve air quality, providing important public health benefits
    to all New Yorkers. These strategies and measures
    include:</p><ul><li>Reducing emissions from commercial charbroiling through
    regulations and technical support to restaurants</li><li>Creating low or
    zero emission freight networks and reducing reliance on
    trucks</li><li>Improving and expanding public transit</li><li>Getting the
    most polluting trucks off New York City streets</li><li>Accelerating the
    phase-out of fossil fuel combustion in buildings focusing on the communities
    most impacted by air pollution related health impacts</li></ul><p>Air
    quality in New York City has greatly improved over the past decade and will
    continue to improve with efforts to control emissions from the most
    important sources.  </p>

## NYCCAS Report: 2008-2021

In 2007, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Health Department) established the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS), the largest ongoing urban air monitoring program of any U.S. city. NYCCAS, which began collecting data in December 2008, is a collaboration between the Health Department and Queens College of the City University of New York and provides data to:

* Help inform PlaNYC, the City’s sustainability plan
* Track changes in air quality over time
* Estimate exposures for health research
* Inform the public about local topics, such as&nbsp;[recent air quality improvements](./../../data-stories/breatheeasy/), [car-free zones](./../../data-stories/aqts/), [changes in the sources of air pollution](./../../data-stories/aq-cooking/), [unique air quality studies conducted in New York City](./../../data-stories/aqsnapshots/), [efforts to reduce health impacts](./../../data-stories/hia/) and [differences in air quality and related health impacts across NYC neighborhoods](./../../data-stories/aq2/).

This report:

* Provides a summary of key findings, the air monitoring program, monitoring site selection, and descriptions of the pollutants measured
* Describes the trends in air pollutant levels from more than a decade of data from winter 2008-2009 through fall 2021 for fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, black carbon, wintertime sulfur dioxide and summertime ozone
* Presents maps of neighborhood air pollution levels by year
* Identifies the local sources that contribute to high levels of these pollutants in New York City neighborhoods

### Key Findings

**Citywide, annual average levels of four key pollutants have gone down between the first year of monitoring, 2009, and the most recent year of data, 2021.**

* Fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-40%
* Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; -38%
* Nitric Oxide (NO)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -58%
* Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -97%

**Air quality improved significantly after local regulations required building owners to convert to cleaner heating oils by 2015.** These heating oils were a major source of SO<sub>2</sub> in New York City. In 2021, only eight of our 90 sites detected any SO<sub>2</sub>, and the levels at those sites were similar to SO<sub>2</sub> levels measured on Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondack Mountains, demonstrating the success of the clean heating oil requirements.

**Air quality changes with location.**

PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, and BC are highest in:

* Areas with higher density of commercial cooking grills and charbroilers
* Industrial areas, specifically areas with higher density of warehouses
* Areas of higher traffic density
* Areas with higher building density

Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) levels are highest in:

* Areas with lower vehicle emissions
