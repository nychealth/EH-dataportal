**About the data:** Data in this archive are hourly averaged measurements of PM2.5 from the New York City Community Air Survey's network of TSI DustTrak sensors. Different sensor technologies will result in different readings; we apply a correction factor to raw data, based on environmental factors, to better match federal regulatory sensors. 

**Measurements:** The value shown is PM2.5 in micrograms per cubic meter of air (Âµg/m3). <code>ObservationTimeUTC</code> datetime stamp displayed is the beginning of the averaged PM2.5 measurements for the hour (e.g. 2/1/2020 1:00:00 AM (UTC) reflects data collected between 2/1/2020 1:00:00 AM (UTC) and 2/1/2020 1:59:00 AM (UTC)).

External factors can sometimes affect monitor functioning. Data are preliminary and subject to change.

**Change Log:** 
- 6/10/2024: Updated correction factor applied to all current and historical data. Data downloaded before this date may differ slightly from data downloaded after this date.
