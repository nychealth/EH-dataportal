Fine particles (PM2.5) are among the most harmful pollutants. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 contributes to an estimated 2,000 excess deaths from lung and heart disease each year in NYC (1 out of every 25 deaths in NYC), and short-term exposure contributes to asthma incidents severe enough to require a trip to the emergency department, and other health threats.

The air quality in NYC is generally good and has been improving over time. For PM2.5, NYC meets the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of an annual average under 12 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, and a 24-hour average under 35 μg/m<sup>3</sup>.

But hour to hour, there is large variation in our air quality - even in neighborhoods with the cleanest air. PM2.5 levels can spike to levels that can harm health, especially for people sensitive to air pollution. These higher levels are driven by daily changes in traffic volume, weather patterns that can trap emissions, and other short-term events.
