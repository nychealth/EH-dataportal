As climate change worsens, extreme heat becomes more frequent and more intense. <a href="{{<baseurl>}}data-stories/localtemp/"> Cities get even hotter because of the urban heat island effect.</a> But even within New York City, some areas are hotter than others.

Extreme heat can <a href="{{< baseurl >}}data-stories/heat/"> harm peopleâ€™s health and about 350 people die from related causes each year in New York City.</a> But these health impacts are not distributed equally. For example, <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/key-topics/climatehealth/heat-report/"> death rates are higher among Black New Yorkers and in neighborhoods with more residents living below the poverty line.</a>

In this Heat Story study, in partnership with South Bronx Unite and Columbia, community groups took local heat measurements and combined them with personal stories on how heat and neighborhood factors affect people's lives, and they show how historic racist patterns of discrimination and disinvestment creates disproportionate impacts of heat, social, economic, and racial inequities, and public health. <a href="#communityScience">Read more about this study</a>.
