                            from heat than from all other weather-related disasters combined,
                            demonstrating the significant morbidity and mortality burden extreme

                        <strong> How does heat affect your life? </strong>
                        <p> It may affect your home, neighborhood, your commute, your daily
                            routines—and your health.

                            <p>The map combines the results of an urban

                            historical and demographic data, the aim of this project is to
                            make visible the relationship between the disproportionate impacts
                            of extreme heat, social inequities, and health.</p>
