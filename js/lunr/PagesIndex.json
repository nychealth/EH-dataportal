        "indicator_descriptions": "This score summarizes features that promote walking, including density of residences, intersections, subway stops, and retail area. Higher scores indicate greater walkability. Neighborhoods range from -4.0 to 9.4, with zero as an approximate NYC average. This indicator excludes some factors that may impact access and walkability, like maintenance, ADA access, neighborhood safety, and street trees.##Vegetative cover is the land covered by trees, grass, or other plants instead of a hard surface like roads, sidewalks, or buildings. Vegetative cover tends to reduce temperatures in the immediate area and may increase air quality.##Tree canopy coverage is the percent of a neighborhood that is shaded by trees. Tree shade can lower a neighborhood's temperatures, can make it more comfortable and attractive to walk and stay active.##Neighborhoods with greater subway access encourage active transportation, which may increase physical activity and overall health of residents. They also tend to have more foot traffic, which attracts businesses and can foster community.##Sidewalks are important for commuting, businesses, and physical activity. Greater sidewalk area can contribute to a safer pedestrian environment, support vibrant business districts and can foster social interaction among residents.##The percentage of the population who live within walking distance to a park: a quarter-mile or less to entrances of smaller sites, such as sitting areas and playgrounds, and half-mile or less to entrances of larger parks. Increased access to green space and open space can contribute to increased levels of physical activity.##A neighborhood's ratio of bodegas to supermarkets can indicate whether the environment makes accessing unhealthy food easier for residents, as bodegas are less likely to have healthy food options than supermarkets.##Bike lanes can improve bicyclist and pedestrian safety, physical activity, and sustainable transportation use. An increase in percentage of streets with bike lanes can indicate a safer cycling environment in a neighborhood which may increase overall cycling.##The percentage of population within a quarter-mile of a subway station entrance. When more people have convenient access to the transit system, they're more likely to use it. Subway access encourages active transportation, which improves the health of residents.##Sanitation supports public health by providing clean, healthy public spaces for people to live, work, and get around. Litter baskets, or trash cans, are associated with a decrease in littering. Enclosed, non-wire baskets are generally better than wire baskets.##The average number of Citi Bikes available to rent per each area between 7am-7pm. Biking bridges gaps in existing public transportation systems and is a great way to exercise. Neighborhoods with lower Citi Bike availability have limited access to this beneficial public resource.##Biking bridges gaps in existing public transportation systems and is a great way to exercise. Neighborhoods with fewer Citi Bike stations have limited access to this beneficial public resource. Neighborhoods with relatively few docks per station may also have limited access to bikes even if they have many stations. The National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) suggests that there should be 28 stations per square mile and one station every 1000 feet.",

shifting becoming warmer with more precipitation and weather extremes Over the past century in New York City average temperatures have increased by 025°F per decade precipitation by 072 inches per decade and sea levels by 12 inches per decade By the 2020s a projected 2530 days above 90°F are expected in a typical summer resulting in more frequent and intense heat waves Rainfall and precipitation are expected to increase by up to 5 together with another 10 inches of sea level rise and increased probability of coastal storms with flooding NYC Panel on Climate Change Climate Risk Information 2009 Climate and Health Even without long term changes in climate New Yorkers face weatherrelated risks today Heat and humidity cause serious illness and death every summer In fact more Americans die from heat waves in a typical year than all other natural disasters combined both in direct mortality from heat stress hyperthermia also known as heat stroke and by way of increases in the usual rates of deaths from natural causes due to the exacerbation of other medical conditions While less common coastal storms also have imparted serious consequences throughout history and in recent years most notably Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 from their devastating direct costs in over 1800 lives along the Gulf Coast to longterm mental health consequences among survivors In 2011 Tropical Storm Irene caused extensive flooding throughout the Northeast and is estimated to be one of the costliest disasters in US history though New York City was largely spared The health impacts of weather events and climate change may be further compounded by power outages arising during heat waves and coastal storms Such effects include gastrointestinal illness due to food spoilage acute carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of generators and illness and death among the medically frail due to mechanical equipment failure lack of air conditioning inability to obtain medical care or extreme exertion such as having to climb many flights of stairs due to elevator outages About the Data and Indicators The Tracking Portal provides data on counts and rates of death hospital admission and treatment in an emergency department for heat stress While these cases can be readily identified with hyperthermia listed as a diagnosis or cause of death it is important to note that they reflect only a portion of the overall health impact of extreme heat Increases in naturalcause hospitalization and death rates during heat waves from cardiovascular disease diabetes and renal disease for example may be estimated using statistical methods Prevention Air conditioning is the most important way to prevent heat stress and death on hot days Those most vulnerable to heat stress include older adults 65 years and people with health conditions including cardiovascular disease diabetes mental illness or other cognitive impairment Some medications can increase heat risk talk to your doctor or pharmacist to learn more about medicationrelated risk and precautions to take during hot weather For air conditioners with a thermostat a setting of 78°F is recommended to provide comfort while not wasting energy Check on those atrisk and assist them in staying cool and well hydrated Seek medical attention immediately if the victim has a rapid heart rate trouble breathing is no longer sweating displays very unusual behavior or loses consciousness Being prepared is key to weathering hurricanes and coastal storms safely Find out if you live in an evacuation zone and stay tuned to TV and radio evacuation messages when a storm approaches Information can be found at wwwnycgov by searching “Hurricane Zones” or by calling 311 Have a “Go Bag” ready for evacuation with copies of IDs and insurance cards bottled water and nonperishable snacks a list of medications and dosages doctors’ phone numbers a first aid kit extra keys a flashlight and battery operated radio and small personal or family care items Keep emergency supplies ready at home to shelter in place if directed a threeday supply of drinking water and nonperishable foods first aid kit flashlight battery operated radio and extra batteries whistle iodine tablets or eyedropper and plain bleach for disinfecting water if directed and a batteryoperated phone Key Messages About 80 of heat stroke victims in New York City are overcome by excessively hot conditions in their own homes as indoor temperatures in the urban environment may be even hotter than outdoor temperatures when an air conditioner is not available or not in use While heatrelated mortality rates are overall substantially lower than in historical periods before electricity and air conditioning a notorious heat wave in 1896 killed approximately 1500 NYC residents we may begin to see a reversal in this trend as a result of rising temperatures depending on the extent of adaptation In 2011 a Health Department survey estimated that 25 of New York City adults still do not have or rarely use air conditioning during hot summer weather many of whom are at increased risk of heat stress due to age or poor health",

public health risks from extreme weather events such as heat waves and coastal storms With climate change the severity of some of these risks will increase A 2013 New York City Panel on Climate Change NPCC report predicts that by the 2020s average summer temperatures in New York City will increase by 20°F to 30°F compared to a 19712000 baseline Heat waves will become more frequent intense and longer in duration Rainfall and precipitation are expected to increase together with another 48 inches of sea level rise and increased probability of coastal storms with flooding NPCC Climate Risk Information 2013 Weather and Health Even without longterm changes in climate New Yorkers face weatherrelated risks today Heat and humidity cause serious illness and death every summer In fact more Americans die from heat waves in a typical year than all other natural disasters combined both in direct mortality from heat stress hyperthermia also known as heat stroke and by way of increases in the rates of deaths from natural causes due to the exacerbation of other medical conditions While far less common coastal storms can also have serious consequences including longterm mental health impacts In 2012 Hurricane Sandy caused extensive flooding and damage in New York City and resulted in at least 44 deaths Power outages can also occur during heat waves and coastal storms Potential health impacts include gastrointestinal illness due to food spoilage carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of generators and illness and death among the medically frail due to mechanical equipment failure and inability to obtain medical care or extreme exertion such as having to climb many flights of stairs in highrise buildings due to elevator outages Lack of air conditioning or home heat may also result in heat and coldrelated illnesses About the Data and Indicators The Tracking Portal provides data on counts and rates of death hospital admission and treatment in an emergency department for heat stress While these cases can be readily identified with hyperthermia listed as a diagnosis or cause of death it is important to note that they reflect only a portion of the overall health impact of extreme heat Increases in naturalcause hospitalization and death rates during heat waves from cardiovascular disease diabetes and renal disease for example may be estimated using statistical methods The Tracking Portal also provides counts and rates of hospital admission and treatment in an emergency department for cold stress As with heat stress data is important to note that cold stress data reflect only a portion of the overall health impact and does not account for potential increases in hospital visits for other conditions that can be exacerbated by cold exposure such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease for example Prevention Air conditioning is the most important way to prevent heat stress and death on hot days Those most vulnerable to heat stress include older adults and people with health conditions including cardiovascular disease diabetes mental illness or cognitive impairments Set air conditioners to 78°F or lowcool to provide comfort while not wasting energy Check on family friends and neighbors atrisk and assist them in staying cool and well hydrated Living without heat or being outdoors in cold weather for a prolonged time can be dangerous Stay indoors as much as possible When outdoors wear layers of warm clothing and cover exposed skin If your home lacks heat get to a warm place if you can and wear warm clothes Report loss of heat or hot water to property managers immediately and call 311 Seniors should take extra care outdoors to avoid slips and falls from icy conditions Protect yourself and your family from carbon monoxide CO poisoninghttpwww1nycgovassetsdohdownloadspdfpublicdohmhnews1001pdf Make sure your home has a working smoke alarm and CO detector If a CO detector goes off in your home immediately open a nearby window go outside for fresh air and call 911 NEVER run a vehicle inside a garage or against a snowbank Clear snow from your car’s tailpipe before running the engine Check on neighbors friends and relatives For more information on preparing for weather hazards– including heat cold coastal storms and power outages – visit the DOHMH extreme weather websitehttpwww1nycgovsitedohhealthemergencypreparednessthreatspage Key Messages About 80 of heat stroke victims in New York City are overcome by excessively hot conditions in their own homes as indoor temperatures in the urban environment may be even hotter than outdoor temperatures when an air conditioner is not available or not in use Although heatrelated mortality rates are lower than in historical periods before electricity and air conditioning it is possible that rates may rise as a result of climate change depending on the extent of adaptation In 2011 a Health Department survey estimated that 25 of New York City adults still do not have or rarely use air conditioning during hot summer weather many of whom may be at increased risk of heat stress due to age or poor health People most likely to be exposed to dangerous cold include those who lack shelter work outdoors andor live in homes with malfunctioning or inadequate heat Seniors infants people with chronic cardiovascular or lung conditions people using alcohol or drugs and people with cognitive impairments or mental health conditions are at increased risk",

        "indicator_descriptions": "Asbestos is a naturally-occurring mineral which was commonly used as an insulation material until the 1970s. Inhaling high concentrations of asbestos fibers over a long time can produce lung inflammation and scarring resulting in the chronic lung disease called asbestosis, a type of pneumoconiosis. New York City construction, insulation, and shipyard workers who installed, disturbed, or removed asbestos without respiratory protection are at risk. Additionally, smokers who are exposed to asbestos have a greater risk of developing asbestos-related diseases than non-smokers. Typically it takes more than ten years from the time of exposure before symptoms develop. The use of proper protective masks is key to preventing the disease, since there is no treatment.##In New York City, the most common cause of lead poisoning in non-pregnant adults is from working in the construction. Workers are exposed by breathing or ingesting lead dust or fumes during work that disturbs old lead based paint. Workers in other industries, as well as hobbyists, may be at risk if they work with lead-containing metal, paint, pigments, ceramic glazes or bullets. Adults can also be exposed to lead through lead-contaminated products, like some imported health remedies, spices, foods, pottery and cosmetics.##Pneumoconiosis is a general term given to any lung disease caused by breathing in certain particles or fibers over a prolonged period. Pneumoconiosis usually results from a workplace exposure. The most common causes of pneumoconiosis include asbestos fibers, silica dust, and coal dust. There is no cure, but it can be prevented with appropriate respiratory protection.##Workers' compensation is a type of insurance that provides medical care for workers who are injured or become ill as a direct result of their job. Hospitalizations billed to workers' comp represent only a portion of work-related injuries that require hospital care. It is important to realize that workers' compensation policies vary from state-to-state with respect to the types of workers covered and the types of injuries and illnesses eligible for compensation##Fatal work-related injuries include deaths resulting from unintentional injuries such as falls, acute poisonings, and motor vehicle crashes that occur during travel for work, and intentional injuries (i.e., homicides and suicides) that occur at work. Fatal injuries that occur during a commute are not included.##Construction is the most dangerous industry in NYC, with nearly a third of work-related injury deaths each year. Falls from scaffolds, ladders and roofs are the most common cause of fatal injuries among construction workers.##Construction is the most dangerous industry in NYC, with nearly a third of work-related injury deaths each year.",

problems infertility and impotence During pregnancy lead exposure can cause miscarriage or babies to be born too soon or too small There is no safe blood lead level at any age Even low levels of lead in the blood can cause health problems Chronic exposure can make lead build up in the body and the longer you have been exposed the more difficult it is for your body to get rid of lead Most people with elevated blood lead levels do not look or feel sick which can make lead poisoning hard to identify The only way to know if you have been exposed to lead is to get a blood lead test from a health care provider The good news Blood lead levels among New Yorkers are declining This continued drop in blood lead levels is likely due to efforts that reduced lead exposures from food water air paint and consumer products Stricter laws and regulations prevention strategies such as screening atrisk populations and public education and outreach have helped For example New York State law requires

Mental Hygiene NYC Health Department receives the results When we the Health Department learn that somebody has an elevated blood lead level we start an investigation asking a long list of questions to find out how the person was exposed to lead and recommending ways for the person to reduce or eliminate their lead exposure This helps us protect New Yorkers with elevated blood lead levels and learn how New Yorkers are exposed to lead Here’s what we have found In NYC the most common source of lead exposure among nonpregnant adults is from constructionrelated jobs Workers can breathe in or ingest lead dust or fumes during renovations repairs and demolitions that disturb old leadbased paint Work or hobbies related to metalwork antique restoration firearms or crafts involving materials with lead can also put adults at risk Read more about what adults should know about lead poisoning here Consumer products can also expose people to lead During our investigations we pay special attention to consumer products from other countries certain health remedies foods and spices cultural powders and traditional cookware Lead is sometimes added to these products either accidentally or intentionally However lead is typically not listed on the label so it is hard to tell the difference between safe and dangerous products For more information visit nycgovhazardousproducts As part of our investigations we work to get these products off NYC store shelves before they endanger people by Routinely visiting shops where we think leadcontaining products might be sold Tracing hazardous products back to the stores where people bought them if reportedly purchased in NYC Taking action when we find hazardous products for sale An investigator looking at potentially contaminated products We buy products from NYC stores and send them to a lab for testing Between 2017 and 2021 We tested around 3000 products and found that over 1800 had detectable levels of lead When we identify a product that has more lead than the allowable limits we take enforcement actions to protect New Yorkers We order the shops to stop selling the contaminated products and require them to post warning signs to inform their customers about the dangers of these products Since 2010 we have surveyed over 1800 businesses and removed over 30000 hazardous consumer products from store shelves You can find more data on consumer products we test on Open Data One type of product that is more likely to contain lead are spices purchased abroad We recommend that New Yorkers buy their spices locally in NYC even if the spices are imported rather than purchasing them abroad A NYC Health Department study on spices collected during investigations between 2008 and 2017 including nearly 1500 samples of spices from 41 countries found that more than half of spice samples had detectable lead concentrations About onethird of the samples had a lead level higher than two parts per million ppm the permissible limit in the US for lead in food additives Spices purchased abroad are more than three times as likely to exceed the permissible amount compared with spices purchased at stores in the US Spices sold in stores in the US are subject to regulatory oversight such as border control checks and surveillance by state and federal agencies which likely decreases the chance of lead contamination in those products functionuse strictwindowaddEventListenermessagefunctionaifvoid 0adatadatawrapperheightvar edocumentquerySelectorAlliframeforvar t in adatadatawrapperheightforvar

using Traditional health remedies including certain Ayurvedic medications prescribed or purchased over the counter in the US or abroad Traditional or handmade ceramic and metal dishware that may contain lead at levels thousands of times higher than regulatory limits Lead in dishware can transfer to the food or drinks that are prepared stored or served in these products Cultural powders such as kohl kajal surma and sindoor Lead can get into the body if a person touches their mouth after handling these products Certain immigrant communities in NYC are at higher risk of lead exposure For example South Asians are more likely to have elevated blood lead levels compared to other NYC residents In addition to lead paint and occupational lead hazards poisonings in this community have been associated with using traditional consumer products Read more about lead poisoning and South Asians in NYC here Take steps to protect yourself and your family from lead exposure If you do construction metal work antique restoration or other work or hobbies that might bring you into contact with lead Use protective clothing and a proper respirator and follow all safety protocols Wash your hands and face before eating drinking or smoking Avoid eating drinking or smoking in the work area Wash your work clothing separately from household laundry Avoid consumer products that may contain lead For more information visit nycgovhazardousproducts If you think you or your family members are at risk for lead poisoning ask your health care provider for a blood lead test Remind your provider to test

        "content": "The air we breathe can have a major effect on our health — air pollution can make asthma worse and can cause heart disease lung disease strokes and even cancer Fortunately New York City has made great strides in recent years to improve air quality Let’s take a look An air quality advisory day happens when air pollution builds up to dangerous levels It means that people who are sensitive to air pollution like people with respiratory or heart problems should spend less time outside and avoid outdoor exercise If the air quality is bad enough then most people will be affected by it Over the years though the number of advisory days has gone down That’s good news for everyone who breathes Whats behind this improvement Since the winter of 20082009 the Health Department has been measuring air quality through the NYC Community Air Survey NYCCAS It’s the largest urban air monitoring program in the USA and measures six different kinds of air pollution at about 100 locations around the city Because of NYCCAS we’ve been able to measure improvements in air quality that are in part due to City regulations and policies For example Efforts by the City to phase out residual heating oil the dirtiest kind have helped wintertime levels of sulfur dioxide go down by 96 percent Citywide average levels for 4 other pollutants have gone down by between 26 and 44 percent A closer look at PM25 in the air One major component of air pollution Fine particles in the air called PM25 We breathe them in and they enter our lungs and bloodstream where they can cause health problems In New York City the current PM25 levels contribute to an estimated 2300 deaths from lung and heart disease each year That means about 1 out of every 20 deaths in New York City is due to this type of air pollution So it’s good news that since monitoring neighborhoodlevel air pollution began in 2009 the levels of PM25 have steadily gone down — which you can see in the chart below By burning heating oil New York Citys buildings are responsible for about 22 percent of the city’s PM25 emissions—and traffic is responsible for another 17 percent see a data story on the Public Health Impacts of PM25 from Traffic Air Pollution That means that reducing traffic and working to make sure that buildings burn cleaner fuel are great ways to clean up the air and help keep our air cleaner and both are important parts of OneNYC the city’s sustainability plan But since 20 to 30 percent of PM25 in NYC comes from outside the city rollbacks of federal regulations like the Clean Power Plan will also affect the quality of our air The City is providing comments to the Environmental Protection Agency in support of stricter emissions standards for power plants cars and trucks so that NYCs air quality continues to improve PM25 is only one piece of the puzzle While NYCCAS has let us see ways that air quality has improved it also identifies areas where we can make better progress For example we’ve learned that Average ozone levels in the summer havent changed in the past 10 years There are higher levels of pollutants in areas of higher traffic density building density and in industrial areas Measuring air quality means we can track improvements and challenges and push for changes in our city and the nation that will reduce air pollution and keep New Yorkers healthy Here at the Health Department we’ll continue monitoring air quality — just as we measure levels of asthma heart disease and lung disease that can be attributed in part to air pollution As air quality improves we expect decreases in disease rates good news for us all",

        "content": "La ciudad de Nueva York posee cientos de vecindarios y casi la misma cantidad de formas de diagramar los límites de los vecindarios Cuando visita el Portal de Datos Ambientales y Sanitarios u otros recursos de datos del Departamento de Salud Health Department es posible que note que la información está disponible en diferentes esquemas de vecindarios Por ejemplo si busca en las páginas de datos sobre asma encontrará que los adultos con asmadataexplorerasthmaid18 se presentan por vecindario de UHF34 los niños de escuelas públicas con asmadataexplorerasthmaid2147 se presentan por vecindarios de UHF42 y las visitas por asma a la sala de emergenciasdataexplorerasthmaid2384 se ofrecen por NTA Se ofrecen otros datos del portal por CD código postal PUMA y en ocasiones incluso por distrito policial ¿Qué son estos esquemas de vecindarios por qué usamos uno y no el otro y por qué no está integrado todo el sistema Los límites más comunes de vecindarios en los datos del Departamento de Salud son vecindarios de Distritos Comunitarios Community Districts CD Áreas de Microdatos de Uso Público Public Use Microdata Areas PUMA y Fondo Hospitalario Unido United Hospital Fund UHF Estos tres esquemas de vecindarios tradicionales poseen diferentes pilares principales Analicémoslos Distritos Comunitarios Existen 59 Distritos Comunitarios Community Districts CD en la ciudad de Nueva York cada uno supervisado por una Junta Comunitaria que brinda asesoramiento sobre el uso de la tierra la zonificación los presupuestos de la ciudad y más Como límite político los CD son unidades geográficas útiles para dividir las operaciones de la ciudad Obtenga más información sobre las Juntas Comunitariashttpswww1nycgovsitecaucommunityboardsaboutcommmunityboardspage Áreas de Microdatos de Uso Público Las Áreas de Microdatos de Uso Público Public Use Microdata Areas PUMA tienen límites definidos por el Censo de los EE UU Están compuestas por grupos de áreas de censo Hay 55 PUMA en la ciudad de Nueva York Las PUMA tienen límites similares a los Distritos Comunitarios lo que significa que a menudo uno puede usarse como representación del otro En el siguiente mapa observe cómo el CD 1 de Brooklyn en GreenpointWilliamsburg es casi idéntico a la PUMA Hay cuatro PUMA compuestas por dos CD combinados en uno Observe cómo dos CD en South Bronx se combinan para formar una PUMA Cada PUMA se divide en áreas de tabulación de vecindarios NTA y cada NTA se divide aún más en áreas de censo Vecindarios del Fondo Hospitalario Unido Los vecindarios del Fondo Hospitalario Unido United Hospital Fund UHF poseen límites basado en códigos postales Esta geografía fue creada por el Departamento de Salud el Fondo Hospitalario Unido y otras agencias de la ciudad en la década de 1980 Se diseñaron para realizar investigaciones sanitarias y para que fuera similar a los Distritos Comunitarios de la ciudad de Nueva York Los datos sanitarios como el registro de hospitalización de alguien por ejemplo o la respuesta a una encuesta suelen incluir el código postal de la persona Es la información geográfica más fácilmente disponible en los datos administrativos La designación del vecindario también es el dato que las personas más conocen y que pueden brindar al responder una encuesta A fin de proteger la privacidad solemos agrupar o conglomerar datos de un área más grande por lo que necesitamos un esquema de vecindarios que estén compuestos por un conjunto de códigos postales UHF La recolección de datos por código postal y su posterior “transformación” en vecindarios de UHF se ha utilizado en la investigación sanitaria durante décadas Los métodos para nuestras encuestas como la Encuesta de Salud Comunitaria están diseñados para incluir a suficientes personas de cada vecindario de UHF a fin de que haya una “muestra representativa” de todos los neoyorquinos y para que podamos comparar los vecindarios con una alta fiabilidad estadística Por lo general usamos los vecindarios de UHF42 que dividen a la ciudad en 42 vecindarios Sin embargo a veces usamos los vecindarios de UHF34 agrupando algunos de los vecindarios podemos aumentar el poder estadístico de una encuesta En el siguiente mapa observe cómo tres vecindarios de UHF42 en South Bronx se combinan en un vecindario de UHF34 y cómo los vecindarios de UHF tienen códigos postales o más precisamente áreas de tabulación de códigos postales como su unidad de origen ¿Cómo escoger cuando los límites se superponen Estos límites de vecindarios diferentes pueden complicar las cosas Por ejemplo supongamos que usted vive en Ditmas Park y quiere obtener algunos datos sanitarios para una reunión de su Junta Comunitaria Ditmas Park es parte del Distrito Comunitario 14 FlatbushMidwood Pero el CD14 abarca dos vecindarios diferentes de UHF Sigue surgiendo una pregunta difícil ¿los datos de qué vecindario llevará a la reunión de la Junta Comunitaria En el Portal de Datos Ambientales y Sanitarios EH sumamos datos de múltiples fuentes diferentes Es posible que no se alineen exactamente de la forma que queremos cuando los datos se recopilan de diferentes formas para fines distintos habrá diferencias en la geografía subyacente disponible El hecho de que no haya una unidad de origen consistente dificulta las cosas Sin embargo cualquier forma de diagramar los límites o de sumar datos aplacará algunas variaciones en los grupos A pesar de las limitaciones en los datos aún podemos observar patrones sanitarios por geografía y obtener información valiosa sobre cómo los vecindarios se diferencian y por qué Los datos sanitarios de los vecindarios tienen mucho que decirnos incluso cuando sus límites no son representaciones perfectas de las comunidades de la ciudad de Nueva York",

        "content": "纽约市有数百个社区和几乎同样多的划分社区边界的方法。当您访问环境与健康数据门户网站或卫生局（Health Department）的其他数据资源时，您可能会注意到数据以多种不同的社区方案呈现。 例如，深入研究哮喘数据页面，您会发现基于UHF34社区方案划分的患有哮喘的成人dataexplorerasthmaid18数据、基于UHF42社区方案划分的患有哮喘的公立学校儿童dataexplorerasthmaid2147数据以及基于NTA方案划分的哮喘急诊科就诊人数dataexplorerasthmaid2384数据。门户网站上提供的其他数据由CD、邮编、PUMA划分，有时甚至依据警察辖区划分。这些社区方案是什么，为什么我们使用这一种而不是另一种，为什么整个系统不一致？ 卫生局数据中最常见的社区边界是社区单元（Community Districts，CD）、公共使用微数据区（Public Use Microdata Areas，PUMA）和联合医院基金社区（United Hospital Fund neighborhoods，UHF）。这三种常见的社区方案具有不同的组成模块。让我们来探索这些吧。 社区单元 纽约市共有59个社区单元（CD），每个社区单元由一个社区委员会监管，该委员会就土地使用、分区、城市预算等提出建议。作为政治边界，CD是有益于分解城市运营的地理单位。了解有关社区委员会的更多信息httpswww1nycgovsitecaucommunityboardsaboutcommmunityboardspage。 公共使用微数据区 公共使用微数据区（Public Use Microdata Areas，PUMA）的边界由美国人口普查定义。他们由人口普查区组成。 纽约市有55个PUMA。PUMA与社区单元具有相似的边界，这意味着通常可以将其中一个用作另一个方案的替代。在下面的地图中，请注意位于GreenpointWilliamsburg的Brooklyn CD 1与PUMA几乎相同。 四个PUMA区域是由两个CD区域合二为一。请注意South Bronx区的两个CD区域是如何合并成一个 PUMA区域。 每个PUMA都细分为社区制表区（NTA），每个NTA进一步细分为人口普查区。 联合医院基金社区 联合医院基金社区（United Hospital Fund neighborhoods，UHF）的边界基于邮编。这个地理单位是由卫生局、联合医院基金社区和其他市政机构在20世纪80年代创建的。它们设计用于健康研究，类似于纽约市的社区单元。 健康数据（例如某人的住院记录或对一项调查的回复）通常包括一个人的邮编。它是行政管理数据中最容易获得的地理信息。这也是大多数人在回答调查时都知道并可以提供的社区指代 为了保护隐私，我们经常捆绑（或汇总）来自一个更大区域的数据，因此我们需要一组由邮编组成的社区方案：UHF。通过邮编收集数据，然后“汇总”到UHF社区，几十年来这种方案一直用于健康研究。我们的调查方法（如社区健康调查）旨在包括来自每个UHF社区的足够多的人口，以便所有纽约人都有一个“代表性样本”，这样我们就能够以统计可信度高的方式对比社区。通常，我们使用UHF42社区方案，将纽约市分为42个社区。不过，有时我们会使用UHF34社区方案——通过将一些社区组合在一起，我们可以提高调查的统计效力。 在下面的地图中，请注意位于South Bronx区的三个UHF42社区如何合并为一个UHF34社区，以及UHF社区如何将邮编（或更准确地说，邮编制表区域）作为其基础单位 当边界重叠时如何选择？ 这些不同的社区边界会使事情变得令人困惑。例如，假设您住在Ditmas Park，并且您想将一些健康数据带到您的社区委员会的一场会议上。Ditmas Park是位于FlatbushMidwood的社区单元14的一部分。但CD14跨越两个不同的UHF社区。 我们有一个工具可以帮助您查看重叠和差异，以便您可以选择使用哪种社区方案进行报告，但它仍然提出了一个难题：您会带哪些社区的数据参加您的社区委员会会议？ 在EH数据门户网站上，我们汇总了来自许多不同来源的数据。它们可能不完全按照我们希望的方式排列：当出于不同目的以不同方式收集数据时，可用的基础地理方案会有所不同。没有一个一致的基础单位确实使事情变得复杂。 但是，任何绘制边界或汇总数据的方式都可以消除组内的某些差异。尽管数据存在局限性，但我们仍然可以按地理位置查看健康模式，并了解有关社区差异及其原因的宝贵信息。社区健康数据可以告诉我们很多信息，即使它们的边界不能完美地代表纽约市的所有社区。",

embargo algunos edificios no son saludables para vivir Los edificios con problemas de mantenimiento y en mal estado pueden dañar la salud En la ciudad de Nueva York los vecindarios de bajos ingresos tienen un mayor porcentaje de edificios en mal estado y las poblaciones negras y latinas tienen menos acceso a viviendas saludables La desigualdad actual data de una historia de racismo y negligencia una práctica conocida como “redlining” que resultó en segregación y que a su vez condujo al mal estado de las viviendas y causó estas disparidades sanitarias Analicemos cómo sucedió esto El racismo ha determinado el lugar de residencia de las personas desde la época colonial El racismo siempre ha desempeñado un papel en los patrones residenciales de la ciudad de Nueva York Cuando la ciudad de Nueva York era una colonia holandesa ocupaba solo el extremo sur de Manhattan Wall Street recibió su nombre por el muro que protegía la ciudad En 1661 cuando las personas negras le solicitaron a la colonia tierras en el área recibieron las tierras ubicadas al norte del muro fuera de la ciudad propiamente dicha A lo largo de la historia muchas prácticas diferentes han moldeado los patrones raciales y residenciales en la ciudad de Nueva York En el siglo XX una práctica denominada “redlining” convirtió al racismo en una política federal con repercusiones duraderas para nuestra situación de vivienda y la salud La política federal impulsó la segregación residencial En estos mapas codificados por colores los vecindarios se dividían en 4 categorías Claramente esta clasificación se originaba en el racismo ya que las descripciones de los vecindarios incluían declaraciones como la siguiente El gobierno les negaba los préstamos a las personas negras y latinas que intentaban comprar viviendas en los vecindarios discriminados por el redlining En su lugar estos recursos se destinaron a comunidades suburbanas nuevas compuestas solo por personas blancas El mapa a continuación muestra cómo se categorizaban los vecindarios de la ciudad de Nueva York Esto era el redlining Este proceso se conoció como “redlining” denegar de forma sistemática recursos públicos y privados según el lugar de residencia de las personas con la comunidad negra como objetivo El redlining ayudó a impulsar la segregación urbana en el siglo XX ya que los nuevos vecindarios se construían para las personas blancas mientras que las personas negras eran obligadas a vivir en vecindarios declarados “en declive” Debido al hecho de que ser propietario de una vivienda es una forma importante de acumular riqueza el redlining también impulsó la desigualdad económica ya que se les negaban a las personas negras las mismas oportunidades de propiedad que tenían los blancos Otras prácticas discriminatorias mantienen la segregación En la actualidad los defensores inmobiliarios señalan que algunos arrendadores continúan con las prácticas discriminatorias y describen el comportamiento de un propietario de esta forma Estas prácticas perpetúan un legado de racismo edilicio mantienen la segregación residencial y con el tiempo resultan en falta de inversión que se da cuando los vecindarios se ven privados de los recursos que sus residentes necesitan para estar saludables y tener oportunidades La falta de inversión condujo al mal estado de las viviendas Durante todo el siglo XX los vecindarios discriminados se deterioraron ya que no poseían inversiones privadas ni recursos del gobierno Es menos probable que los arrendadores en estos vecindarios mantengan adecuadamente las viviendas Como resultado muchas viviendas tienen problemas de mantenimiento graves y crónicos Explore los problemas comunes de vivienda de la ciudad de Nueva York en el siguiente mapa Porcentaje de hogares con problemas sanitarios de vivienda ¿Quiénes asumen la carga del mal estado de la vivienda Estos problemas van más allá de la incomodidad o el desastre Como resultado de la segregación y la falta de inversión provocadas por el redlining las poblaciones negras y latinas tienen menos acceso a viviendas saludables Es más probable que vivan en edificios que tienen problemas de mantenimiento amenazantes para la salud Estas disparidades persisten en los niveles de ingresos Las personas negras y latinas tienen menos acceso a viviendas saludables pero esto no se debe a índices de pobreza más altos en estas poblaciones Las personas negras y latinas con ingresos más altos también son más propensas a vivir en edificios con problemas graves de mantenimiento lo que sugiere que el racismo está detrás de estas disparidades Estos problemas sanitarios de vivienda no se pueden arreglar con un poco de organización son consecuencia de la negligencia crónica del mantenimiento por parte de la administración de los edificios y los arrendadores y el mal estado de las viviendas después de años de falta de inversión Además las disparidades en el acceso a viviendas saludables están relacionadas con prácticas inmobiliarias que mantienen la segregación El racismo y la falta de inversión se ven en los datos sanitarios La falta de inversión en los vecindarios negros hace que las viviendas estén en mal estado lo que a su vez crea viviendas insalubres El mal estado el moho y las plagas provocan ataques de asma que hacen que los niños con asma deban acudir al hospital lo que suele ser una experiencia aterradora para los niños y sus cuidadores Como resultado las tasas más altas de visitas por asma a la sala de emergencias de niños de entre 5 y 14 años se dan en vecindarios en los que residen principalmente personas negras Un hogar saludable debe ser un derecho Una vivienda en buen estado es fundamental Brinda protección del clima Es un lugar para estar a salvo Es un lugar en el que su familia puede crecer y prosperar Sin embargo una vivienda insalubre y mal mantenida no puede ofrecer un lugar seguro Al contrario presenta un entorno peligroso Entonces ¿cómo podemos crear una ciudad en la que la raza y el

some buildings arent healthy places to live Buildings with maintenance issues and disrepair can harm health Across NYC lowincome neighborhoods have a higher percentage of buildings in disrepair – and Black and Latino people have less access to healthy housing Today’s inequality can be traced to a history of racism and neglect a practice known as redlining resulted in segregation which in turn drove housing disrepair and led to these health disparities Lets explore how Racism has determined where people live since colonial times Racism has always played a role in residential patterns in New York City When New York City was a Dutch colony it was just the southern tip of Manhattan Wall Street got its name from the city’s protective wall In 1661 when Black people petitioned the colony for land in the area they were given land north of the wall outside of the city proper Throughout history many different practices have shaped racial and residential patterns in New York City In the 20th century a practice called redlining made racism a federal policy – with longlasting repercussions for our housing and our health Federal policy drove residential segregation On these colorcoded maps neighborhoods were divided into 4 categories This classification was clearly rooted in racism since neighborhood descriptions included statements like The government denied loans to Black and Latino people trying to buy homes in redlined neighborhoods Instead these resources went to new Whiteonly suburban communities The map below shows how New York Citys neighborhoods were categorized This was redlining This process became known as redlining systematically denying public and private resources based on where people live targeting people of color Redlining helped drive urban segregation in the 20th century as new neighborhoods were built for white people while people of color were forced into neighborhoods declared to be declining Since homeownership is an important way to accrue wealth redlining drove economic inequality too by denying people of color the same opportunities for home ownership that white people had Other discriminatory practices maintain segregation Today housing advocates say that some landlords continue discriminatory practices describing one landlord’s behavior this way These practices continue a legacy of housing racism maintain residential segregation and over time result in disinvestment when neighborhoods are deprived of resources that their residents need for health and opportunity Disinvestment led to housing disrepair Throughout the 20th century redlined neighborhoods deteriorated as they were deprived of private investment and government resources Landlords in these neighborhoods are less likely to adequately maintain homes As a result many homes have severe and chronic maintenance problems Explore NYCs common housing problems in the map below Percent of households with healthy housing problems Who shoulders the burden of housing disrepair These problems go far beyond inconvenience or mess As a result of the segregation and disinvestment caused by redlining Black and Latino people have less access to healthy housing They are more likely to live in buildings that have healththreatening maintenance issues These disparities persist across income levels Black and Latino people have less access to healthy housing but this isn’t due to higher poverty rates in these populations Black and Latino people with higher incomes are also more likely to live in buildings with serious maintenance issues further suggesting that racism is behind these disparities These healthy housing problems can’t be fixed by a little bit of tidying up – they stem from chronic neglect of maintenance by building management and landlords and old housing stock in disrepair after decades of disinvestment And the disparities in access to healthy housing are related to real estate practices that maintain segregation Racism and disinvestment show up in health data Disinvestment in neighborhoods of color leads to housing disrepair which in turn creates unhealthy homes Disrepair mold and pests trigger asthma attacks sending children with asthma to hospitals an often frightening experience for both children and their caregivers As a result the highest rates of asthma emergency department visits for children age 5 to 14 are in neighborhoods that are home largely to people of color A healthy home should be a right A home in good repair is vital It’s protection from the weather It’s a place for you to be safe It’s a place where your family can grow and thrive But a poorly maintained unhealthy home can’t provide a truly safe haven Instead it presents a dangerous environment So how can we create a city in which race and

like social structures that limit access to basic needs such as health care which are perpetuated by racism residential segregation — like redlining — and systematic disinvestment in neighborhoods

means people use for homicides and suicides we can take steps to prevent these deaths In NYC most homicide deaths among young and middleaged adults occur with guns Nationwide guns account for about 8 out of every 10 homicide deaths Stabbing was the second most common mechanism of homicide deaths in NYC Hanging is the leading mechanism of suicides among young and middleaged New Yorkers whereas guns are the leading mechanism of suicides nationwide Guns are responsible for relatively few suicides among adults ages 15 to 44 in NYC Access to means is a key risk factor for suicide and how easily and how often certain suicide means are used are shaped by our environments Means reduction— removing access to ways people can attempt suicide — is a key part of a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy Many people who attempt suicide do so during a shortterm crisis and therefore spend relatively little time thinking about the attempt before taking action According to one study of suicide attempt survivors nearly half spent less than 10 minutes For these people especially the availability of lethal means for example access to a firearm or jumping from a building can be the difference between thinking about suicide and making an attempt The more lethal the means the more likely a person will not survive an attempt The means reduction approach applies to homicides too Data show that where there are more guns there is more homicide New York has had stricter gun laws than many other places in the United States and that may help explain why New York City’s homicide rate is lower than other places in the country and below the national average Whether the 2022 Supreme Court decision in NYS Rifle and Pistol Association v Bruen — which struck down New York State’s longstanding protective gun law — will result in an increase gun availability and in rates of suicide and homicide is still unknown When there are fewer guns however we can expect to see fewer homicide deaths and as access to guns increases we can expect to see the reverse Prevention’s greatest impacts will come when integrating multiple approaches Means reduction is a critical part of prevention including restricting relocating or removing lethal means like certain medications firearms and sharp objects or placing protective barriers on decks or rooftops This prevention approach should be combined with examining and remediating the upstream drivers of homicide and suicide — such as quality and availability of housing education jobs opportunities health care parks strong social networks and more Each of these deaths is a tragedy — but solutions exist Limiting access to mechanisms of homicide and suicide can be a critical tool in preventing deaths among young and middleaged adults Further resources

electric machine that turns liquid medicine into a mist that your child breathes in through a face mask But the power is out Without the nebulizer your child’s breathing gets worse and you wonder is it time to go to the hospital again This scenario or something like it is a reality for many New Yorkers Asthma and many other medical conditions are treated athome with electrical medical equipment Citywide 76 of households include someone who uses electric medical equipment with some neighborhoods at nearly 17dataexplorerhousingsafetyid2377 As the chart above shows neighborhoods with more households that rely on electrical medical equipment also have higher rates of poverty Power outages threaten health On Thursday August 14 2003 a widespread power outage stretched from NYC to Ontario Canada affecting 55 million people Many areas including here in New York City were without power for days In New York City the power outage started around 410pm on the 14th a day when temperatures were in the 90s While the power was restored in some neighborhoods by early morning on the 15th full power for the entire city did not return until that evening That blackout was dangerous for NYC residents and we can see the effects in health data Hospitalizations for respiratory problems spiked above predicted levels The health impacts were not limited to just hospitalizations In fact the power outage was deadly The deaths could have been caused by many dangers of power outages people not being able to charge medical equipment not being able to use air conditioning on hot days or experiencing increased physical and mental stress and isolation of living without elevators or subways And when we studied hospitalization and mortality data around NYC’s smaller blackouts in July 1999 and July 2006 we saw that localized power outages also threaten healthhttpspubmedncbinlmnihgov29894117 We found an increase in hospitalizations for respiratory disease renal kidney disease and an increase in allcause mortality deaths Climate change is likely to bring more power outages Weatherrelated power outages are increasing as climate change brings more frequent more powerful storms that threaten our power grid and other physical infrastructure The chart below from wwwclimatecentralorghttpswwwclimatecentralorg shows the increasing frequency of weatherrelated power outages over the last 20 years While there are yeartoyear differences the overall increasing trend is clear but not all NYC residents are prepared Our survey found that 58 of NYC residents have basic preparation for power outageshttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMC6181821 a working flashlight and a 3day supply of water and food People with household members who depend on electrical medical equipment are more likely to be prepared for power outages 70 vs 56 of respondents without electricdependent household members However even though they are more prepared they report not _feeling_ more prepared as they face the challenge of ensuring that their medical equipment runs during power outages when you need electricity to stay healthy it’s hard to feel completely prepared for a blackout Stay prepared It’s important for our City to build a power grid that is resilient since we expect more extreme weather as our climate continues to change As we experience this changing climate a reliable supply of electricity is crucial to support lifesaving equipment And it’s vital that this resiliency be equitable so that people in highpoverty neighborhoods that have been deprived of resources aren’t made additionally vulnerable by climate change and power outages But we can also expect some power outages so it’s important for residents to be prepared especially if you or somebody in your household uses medical equipment that requires electricity including nebulizers dialysis machines apnea monitors or portable oxygen Tell your utility provider if you use electricpowered medical equipment They

        "content": "Throughout history the distribution of wealth in the US has and continues to be largely unequal between racial groups This concept is referred to as the racial wealth gap and it has its roots in settler colonialism and enslavement There is an especially big wealth disparity between White families and Black families which was established and upheld by racist historical policies and practices The racial wealth gap has major implications for public health This is because a large and growing body of research reveals that having good health is connected to having wealth Effective solutions to racial inequities in wealth and health must address challenges at the individual household community and systems levels White families hold nearly eight times the wealth of the average Black family Income and wealth are two different concepts Income is measured by earnings while wealth is the difference between the value of assets owned and the amount owed in debts Since wealth incorporates the value of assets accumulated over time and can be passed down over generations it provides a more comprehensive representation of one’s economic resources The Federal Reserve Board’s 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances SCF shows that nationally the average White family holds nearly eight times the wealth of the average Black family and over five times the wealth of the average Hispanic family functionuse strictwindowaddEventListenermessagefunctionaifvoid 0adatadatawrapperheightvar edocumentquerySelectorAlliframeforvar t in adatadatawrapperheightforvar r0relengthrifercontentWindowasourcevar iadatadatawrapperheighttpxerstyleheighti Racist and discriminatory policies have prevented Black families from accruing assets financial security and wealth For much of American history there has been a record of racist systematic policies implemented by the federal government that helped build wealth for White households while suppressing wealth accumulation for other groups including Black and Hispanic households The BlackWhite wealth disparity in particular has been created and reinforced by systematic policies and practices including racial segregation laws redlining the discriminatory implementation of the New Deal and the GI Bill and more The intergenerational impacts of the enslavement of Black people have broad impacts on the wealth and health inequities observed today Greater wealth translates to better health While net worth is found to be a protective factor against poor health assets such as savings stock ownership or homeownership are found to consistently improve health and debts such as student loans credit card debt or medical debt are associated with worse health even after adjusting for total net worth White households are more likely than Black and Hispanic households to hold all asset types Ultimately the median White household has assets more than four times the value of those held by the median Black household underscoring that the racial wealth gap is primarily driven by differences in asset holdings Explore how wealth translates to health Wealth allows families to access better medical care… Wealth is strongly correlated with individual and population health in more ways than one Wealth allows families to afford better medical care higher quality insurance and goods and services that promote physical and mental wellbeing Liquid assets like savings and stocks allow households to more readily pay for basic needs preventative and routine medical care and weather financial shocks …and to live in healthpromoting neighborhoods Greater wealth allows people to live in neighborhoods with fewer environmental hazards and more resources like healthier housing Wealth can reduce stress from financial challenges Wealth can protect families from the negative consequences of financial hardship including job loss homelessness or housing insecurity food insecurity and the negative psychological effects associated with financial hardship Intergenerational wealth passed down through inheritance can provide educational and social opportunities that can benefit health in the long run Debt and tight budgets lead to reduced spending on medical care and preventative lifestyle habits Conversely research shows that when household budgets are constrained families tend to reduce spending on medical care groceries and other healthrelated goods Households with limited liquid assets may be less able to afford healthpromoting opportunities for example quality medical care physical activity etc and more likely to forgo preventative or emergency medical treatments Financial hardship is consistently correlated with poorer selfrated health more chronic diseases and depressive symptoms in children and adults Debt and lower incomes impact socioemotional wellbeing in negative ways Debt type plays an important role in health and wellbeing in both positive and negative ways For instance higher levels of home and student loan debt are associated with greater socioemotional wellbeing for children whereas higher levels of and increases in unsecured debt for example credit card debt are associated with lower levels of and declines in child socioemotional wellbeing respectively At the household level high debts or low assets can increase anxiety frustration and hopelessness and can also lead to health deterioration due to stress When looking at young adults with student debt those with high levels of debt stress reported feeling more tense and anxious troubled by physical problems and had greater difficulty getting to sleep than students with low levels of debt stress BlackWhite racial health inequities havent improved Data shows that BlackWhite racial health inequities have not narrowed over time For example BlackWhite ratios of mortality from coronary heart disease cancer diabetes cirrhosis of the liver and infant mortality were larger in the late 1990s than in 1950 Between 2019 and 2021 the US experienced a widening of its life expectancy gap during the COVID19 pandemic with Hispanic and nonHispanic Black populations

the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in partnership with the NYC Health Department convened experts from the nonprofit research policy and government sectors in a series of roundtable discussions to share their thoughts on the solutions policies and tools that should be considered to meaningfully address racial wealth and health gaps in the US These experts noted that bold public policy better data collection and increased community ownership are needed From the convening it was noted that policies like universal health care medical debt cancellation and increasing community ownership can help improve health and address healthrelated financial inequities—while policies like reparations can directly address the racial wealth gap Universal health care By providing lowcost health care to all Americans universal health care would help prevent individuals from acquiring medical debt and its subsequent deleterious effects on health and financial security Medical debt cancellation Medical debt or medical costs people are unable to pay upfront or when they received care unequally impacts racial and ethnic communities Estimates by the US Census Bureau show that 28 percent of Black households carry medical debt compared with 17 percent of White households Student debt cancellation According to the 2019 SCF Black Americans hold the most student loan debt — $44880 on average — compared to other races and ethnicities Baby bonds Baby bonds are an innovative policy that provide children with publicly funded investment accounts that can be accessed beginning at the age of 18 for specific uses including education homeownership small business and retirement Any baby bonds proposal should allocate the most resources to Black Hispanic and indigenous children Reparations A reparations program such as federally paid cash to Black descendants of enslaved people would eliminate the BlackWhite wealth gap if the payment amounts were predicated on the average difference in

        "content": "La política financiera de 90 años que daña nuestra salud En la salud pública solemos citar el racismo estructural para ayudar a explicar los patrones sanitarios en nuestra sociedad Pero ¿qué significa esto específicamente Una mirada más profunda a la historia del redlining muestra esta conexión Cuando analizamos datos sobre la salud de los neoyorquinos solemos encontrar los mismos patrones geográficos con índices más altos de afecciones médicas evitables en vecindarios con más pobreza Por ejemplo escribimos sobre cómo el asma y la pobreza están estrechamente relacionadas Estos vecindarios con altos índices de pobreza también albergan una mayor cantidad de personas negras que otras comunidades La siguiente tabla muestra la relación entre el índice de pobreza de cada vecindario y el porcentaje de la población negra con el índice de visitas infantiles por asma a la sala de emergencias representado por el tamaño de cada burbuja Esta dinámica de extiende más allá del asma Para entender por qué la pobreza la raza y la salud están relacionadas en la ciudad de Nueva York es necesario revisar el redlining Esta política del gobierno de la década de 1930 ilustra la naturaleza de la pobreza y el racismo en nuestra sociedad y muestra cómo el racismo afecta la salud Una breve historia del redlining En la década de 1930 durante la Gran Depresión las tasas de desempleo eran altas y muchas personas no podían pagar su hipoteca Una ola de ejecuciones hipotecarias se extendió en el país Para ayudar a que las personas conservaran sus viviendas el gobierno federal estableció la Corporación de Préstamos para Propietarios de Viviendas Home Owners Loan Corporation HOLC Su objetivo era refinanciar las hipotecas con mejores términos como tasas de interés más bajas y períodos de compensación más prolongados para ayudar a las personas a efectuar los pagos y evitar las ejecuciones hipotecarias Para determinar qué préstamos podía garantizar la HOLC envió personas a tasar vecindarios en las ciudades de los EE UU Determinaron los tipos de viviendas en los vecindarios junto con información sobre las personas que vivían allí También catalogaron las “influencias perjudiciales” con descripciones racistas como “infiltración de negros” y “razas mixtas” como características que reducían el valor de un vecindario Documento de redlining que detalla las viviendas el tipo de construcción la antigüedad promedio las condiciones de reparación la ocupación el rango de precio y otra información Un documento de redlining que indica lo siguiente Influencias perjudiciales Obsolescencia y mantenimiento deficiente Infiltración de negros Estructuras elevadas en Lexington Ave y Fulton y Grand Avenue Razas mixtas Con esta información la HOLC diagramó “mapas de seguridad residencial” para casi 250 ciudades incluida la ciudad de Nueva York En estos mapas la HOLC les dio a los vecindarios una clasificación El gobierno usaba estas clasificaciones para determinar si otorgaría préstamos Los bancos las usaban para determinar si las personas eran elegibles para una hipoteca y no otorgaban préstamos para comprar viviendas en los vecindarios “en declive” o “peligrosos” Esto era el redlining el establecimiento de límites alrededor de los vecindarios según la raza de los residentes y la privación de recursos y oportunidades lo que efectivamente racializaba la pobreza en las ciudades de todos los EE UU Esto es el racismo estructural donde el racismo se introduce en las normas de la sociedad El mapa a continuación muestra el alcance del redlining en la ciudad de Nueva York El redlining impulsó la segregación residencial Como resultado del redlining a las personas negras se les negaba el acceso a los vecindarios “atractivos” con prácticas inmobiliarias racistas y se les negaban préstamos para comprar viviendas en vecindarios catalogados como “en declive” o “peligrosos” Los agentes inmobiliarios también usaban tácticas explotadoras como Ser propietario de una vivienda es una forma poderosa de alcanzar estabilidad financiera Estas políticas concentraban a las personas negras en vecindarios privados de inversiones y no les permitían acceder a préstamos ni comprar una vivienda mientras que los residentes blancos recibían más recursos y oportunidades Se discriminaron grandes áreas de la ciudad de Nueva York Explore el alcance del redlining de la HOLC en los cinco distritos de la ciudad de Nueva York Los efectos del redlining continúan en la actualidad En la ciudad de Nueva York muchos vecindarios que alguna vez fueron prósperos sufrieron una grave falta de inversión como resultado del redlining lo que provocó desigualdades que continuaron de una generación a otra Los vecindarios discriminados en la década de 1930 tienen índices de pobreza más altos incluso en la actualidad casi 90 años después de la creación de los mapas Según la Coalición Nacional de Reinversión Comunitariahttpsncrcorgholc 3 de cada 4 vecindarios en los EE UU que fueron discriminados en la década de 1930 aún son de ingresos bajos a moderados en la actualidad y 2 de cada 3 poseen una población mayoritariamente negra El redlining es el principal ejemplo de negar o retener fondos públicos y privados servicios de la ciudad y otros recursos que los vecindarios y sus residentes necesitan para progresar Cuando se retienen estos recursos se crean “entornos que enferman a las personas”httpswwwwhointhdppovertyen Las políticas como el redlining nos demuestran que la pobreza no se trata solo de la mala suerte la incapacidad para encontrar un buen empleo o el hecho de no trabajar lo suficiente La pobreza es más profunda y más poderosa generaciones de carencias y falta de inversión que niegan recursos oportunidades riqueza y salud a las personas y los vecindarios a menudo impulsados por el racismo Si bien el redlining se prohibió en 1968 persisten otras formas de discriminación edilicia Sin embargo el redlining fue especial por el modo en el que empeoró la pobreza y la segregación en las ciudades de todos los EE UU dejando un legado de disparidades económicas y raciales en las consecuencias para la salud La

        "content": "Inside the 90yearold financial policy that harms our health In public health we often cite structural racism to help explain health patterns in our society But what specifically does this mean A close look at the history of redlining shows this connection When we analyze data on the health of New Yorkers we often find the same geographic patterns with higher rates of preventable health conditions in highpoverty neighborhoods For example weve written about how asthma and poverty are closely connected These highpoverty neighborhoods are also home to a higher proportion of people of color than other communities The chart below shows the relationship between each neighborhoods poverty rate and percent population of color with the rate of childhood asthma ED visits represented by the size of each bubble This dynamic extends beyond asthma To understand why poverty race and health are related in New York City we look back at redlining This government policy from the 1930s illustrates the nature of poverty and racism in our society and how racism affects health A Brief History of Redlining In the 1930s during the Great Depression unemployment rates were high and many people couldnt make their mortgage payments A wave of foreclosures swept the country To help keep people in their homes the federal government established the Home Owners Loan Corporation HOLC Its goal was to refinance mortgages with better terms like lower interest rates and longer repayment periods to help people make payments and avoid foreclosure To determine what loans they would guarantee HOLC sent people to appraise neighborhoods in cities across the US They documented the types of housing in neighborhoods along with information about the people who lived there They also catalogued “detrimental influences” with racist descriptions like “infiltration of Negroes” and “mixed races as characteristics that lowered a neighborhoods value A redlining document that details housing construction type average age repair condition occupancy price range and other information A redining document that reads Detrimental influences Obsolescence and poor maintenance Infiltration of Negroes Elevated structures on Lexington Ave Fulton Grand Avenue Mixed races With this information HOLC made “residential security maps” for almost 250 cities including New York City On these maps HOLC gave each neighborhood a classification The government used these classifications to determine whether to guarantee loans Banks used them to determine if people were eligible for mortgages and wouldnt provide loans to buy homes in the declining or hazardous neighborhoods This was redlining drawing boundaries around neighborhoods based on residents race and depriving them of resources and opportunities effectively racializing poverty in cities across the US This is structural racism where racism is built into the rules of society The map below shows the extent of redlining in New York City Redlining drove residential segregation As a result of redlining people of color were denied access to “desirable” neighborhoods by racist real estate practices and denied loans to buy homes in neighborhoods labeled declining or hazardous Real estate agents also used exploitative tactics like Owning a home is a powerful way to achieve financial stability These policies concentrated people of color in neighborhoods deprived of investment and prevented them from accessing loans and buying property while while white residents were provided more resources and opportunities Enormous areas of New York City were redlined Explore the extent of HOLCs redlining in NYCs five boroughs Redlinings effects continue today In New York City many oncethriving neighborhoods experienced severe disinvestment as a result of redlining which caused inequality that continued from one generation to the next Neighborhoods that were redlined in the 1930s have higher rates of poverty even today – nearly 90 years after the maps were created According to the National Community Reinvestment Coalitionhttpsncrcorgholc 3 out of every 4 neighborhoods in the USA that were redlined in the 1930s are still lowtomoderate income today and 2 out of every 3 are predominantly populated by people of color Redlining is a prime example of denying or withholding public and private funding city services or other resources that neighborhoods and their residents need to thrive When these resources are withheld it creates environments that make people sickhttpswwwwhointhdppovertyen Policies like redlining show us that poverty isnt a bit of bad luck inability to find a good job or not working hard enough Poverty is deeper and more powerful generations of deprivation and disinvestment withholding resources opportunity wealth and health from people and neighborhoods often driven by racism Though redlining was banned in 1968 other forms of housing discrimination persist But redlining was special because of how it worsened poverty and segregation in cities across the United States leaving a legacy of income and racial disparities in health outcomes Public health is

        "content": "危害我们健康90年的金融政策 在公共卫生领域，我们经常引用结构性种族主义来解读我们社会的健康模式。但是，具体来说，这意味着什么？仔细看一下红线圈定的历史就可以看出这种联系。 当我们分析纽约人健康的数据时，我们经常会发现相同的地理模式，在高贫困率的社区中，可预防的健康状况发生率更高。例如，我们已经写过哮喘和贫困是如何密切相关的。 这些高贫困率的社区中，有色人种的比例也高于其他社区。 下面的图表显示了每个社区的贫困率和有色人种的百分比之间的关系，每个气泡的大小代表了儿童哮喘患者的急诊就诊率。 这种趋势在哮喘以外的疾病中也适用。要了解在纽约市为什么贫困、种族和健康是息息相关的，我们回顾一下红线圈定。20世纪30年代的这项政府政策说明了我们社会中贫困和种族主义的本质，以及种族主义如何影响健康。 红线圈定的简史 在20世纪30年代的大萧条时期，许多人无法偿还抵押贷款。一波止赎法拍的浪潮席卷全国。为了帮助人们保住自己的房子，联邦政府成立了房主贷款公司（Home Owners Loan Corporation，HOLC）。其目标是用更优惠的条件（例如更低的利率和更长的还款期）为抵押贷款提供再融资，以帮助人们还款并避免房屋被止赎法拍。 为了确定他们可以担保哪些贷款，HOLC派人去评估美国各地城市的社区房屋价值。他们记录了社区的住房类型，以及居住者的信息。他们还对“有害影响”进行了分类，将“黑人渗透”和“混血”等种族主义描述作为降低社区价值的特征。 详细说明住房、建筑类型、平均屋龄、维修条件、入住率、价格范围和其他信息的红线圈定文档。 一份红线圈定文件，内容如下：有害影响：过时和维护不善。黑人渗透。Lexington Ave和Fulton和Grand Avenue上的高架结构。混合人种。 根据这些信息，HOLC为包括纽约市在内的近250个城市制作了“住宅安全地图”。在这些地图上，HOLC给每个社区指定一个分类： 政府使用这些分类来确定是否为贷款提供担保。银行利用它们来确定人们是否有资格获得抵押贷款，并且不会提供贷款在“没落中”或“危险”社区购买住房。 这就是红线圈定——根据居民的种族划分社区边界，剥夺他们的资源和机会，其有效地将美国各地城市的贫困种族化。这是结构性的种族主义：将种族主义纳入社会规则。 下面的地图显示了纽约市的红线圈定范围。 红线圈定导致了住宅隔离 由于红线圈定，有色人种被种族主义的房地产行为剥夺了进入“理想”社区的机会，也无法获取贷款在标记为“没落中”或“危险”的社区购买房屋。房地产经纪人还利用诱骗房产主贱卖房地产、合同操纵和种族限制契约等剥削性策略来加深和加强社区隔离。 诱骗房产主贱卖房地产是房地产经纪人使用的一种手段。由于许多白人将有色人种视为对他们所在社区的社会和经济威胁，房地产经纪人会告诉白人房主，有色人种即将搬进该社区。 这将使房主相信他们的房子会贬值，因此他们会以更低的价格出售。房地产经纪人转手就把房产以抬高的价格卖给有色人种。 合同操纵是一种欺骗性和剥削性的房地产行为，以通过私人贷款购买住房的有色人种为目标。这些贷款通常利率很高且包含操纵条款——在某些情况下，买家仅错过一次还款期限就会迫使其放弃他们的房子。 这些合同通常迫使买主支付比房屋价值本身更高的价格。 种族限制条款是房产契约中防止业主将房产卖给有色人种的一项条款。 种族限制条款是一种强制实行住宅隔离的方式，以确保有色人种被排除在白人社区之外。 拥有房屋是实现财务稳定的有效途径。这些政策将有色人种集中在缺乏投资的社区，阻止他们获得贷款和购买房产，同时为白人居民提供了更多的资源和机会。 纽约市的大片地区被划为红线圈定区。研究HOLC在纽约市五个行政区的红线圈定范围： 红线圈定的影响今天仍在继续 在纽约市，许多曾经欣欣向荣的社区由于红线圈定而经历了严重的投资缩减，这导致了一代又一代的不平等。即使在地图绘制近90年后的今天，20世纪30年代被红线圈定的社区仍然有更高的贫困率。根据全国社区再投资联盟 全国社区再投资联盟 National Community Reinvestment Coalitionhttpsncrcorgholc）的数据，在20世纪30年代被红线圈定的美国社区中，每4个中就有3个至今仍处于低收入到中等收入水平，并且每3个中就有2个主要居民为有色人种。 红线圈定是社区投资缩减的一个主要例子：拒绝或扣留公共和私人资金、城市服务或社区及其居民繁荣所需的其他资源。当这些资源被扣留时，它会创造 “让人们厌恶的环境”httpswwwwhointhdppovertyen。 投资缩减可以是： 拒绝为人们提供贷款买房：例如通过红线圈定和其他有据可查的种族主义房地产行为 业主忽视住房，导致住房不健康 住房、学校和其他重要服务的公共资金减少 工作机会减少和低薪工作 强调对亲社会资源的监管 像红线圈定这样的政策告诉我们，贫困并不是运气不好、找不到好工作或工作不够努力。贫困的诱因更深层、更强大：几代人的贫困和投资缩减剥夺了人们和社区的资源、机会、财富和健康，这通常由种族主义驱动。 尽管红线圈定在1968年遭到禁止，但其他形式的住房歧视依然存在。但红线圈定是特别的：因为它加剧了美国各地城市的贫困和种族隔离，在健康结果方面留下了收入和种族差异的遗留问题。 公共卫生不仅仅是在个人层面上改变人们的行为：它关乎于建立一个支持健康和福祉的社会，并通过直面过去走向未来。 关于红线圈定的更多资源 反映不平等：美国新政时期的红线圈定（Redlining in New Deal America）httpsdslrichmondedupanoramaredliningloc436719693opacity08 在此处您可以探索您所在社区的红线圈定图和原始文档。 种族隔离和经济不平等的持续结构httpsncrcorgholc 来自全国社区再投资联盟（National Community Reinvestment Coalition）。",

ways to get around that feel safe—redistributing transit among different modes to ease crowding and increase safety on public transportation As more New Yorkers use bicycles lets take a look at safety on our streets Cyclist safety in public health data New York City’s streets offer opportunities for active transportation like cycling and walking but can also pose risks from collisions We had a stark reminder of that in 2019 when 28 cyclists died on NYC streets following an historic low of 10 in 2018httpswwwnycvzvinfo We can look at data to understand how to maximize health promotion and minimize risk Public health data include hospitalization and emergency department ED data which track injuries to cyclists as well as pedestrians Along with these injury statistics we have data on traffic density eg measured in vehicle miles traveled on specific roads infrastructure eg the presence of bike lanes and cycling eg how many people regularly bicycle to get around When we look at these data together a safety in numbers story emerges the more extensive the infrastructure and the more people riding bicycles the safer streets are as an environment for physical activity Let’s take a closer look Disparities in NYCs trafficrelated injuries When we look at data on trafficrelated injuries by borough in New York City Brooklyn and Queens show higher rates of hospitalization and ED

bike lanes—but in Brooklyn only 13 percent of streets do This is consistent with research that shows that bicycle networks offer protection to people on the streets Safety in numbers The idea of “safety in numbers” comes from a study that found that “a motorist is less likely to collide with a person walking and bicycling if more people walk or bicycle”httpsinjurypreventionbmjcomcontent93205 This is probably because as the number of people walking and cycling increases motorists become more attentive So as the number of cyclists rises we expect to see injury rates go down Ongoing work to promote cycling will help lower injury rates Expanding bike share networks increasing bicycle network coverage and continuing to build protective street environments—like separated bike lanes—can get more riders on the street and offer them greater protection This effect is apparent when we look at differences between Manhattan and Brooklyn—and apply what we learn throughout the city Disparities in cycling by sex raceethnicity age and neighborhood poverty also need to be addressed through equitably focused safety improvementshttpsa816healthnycgovhdiepiqueryvisualizationsPageTypetsPopulationSourceCHSTopic4Subtopic35 since safety in numbers works best if we increase safety for everyone—starting where it is most needed As New York City continues to grapple with the COVID19 pandemic many New Yorkers may turn to biking as a good way to get around while still keeping a safe distance from others Our data show us that there is a clear connection between road infrastructure and street safety That means that one way to keep New Yorkers safe during this public health emergency—and beyond—is to continue building

no es necesario pasar por esto solo Llame al 1888NYCWELL 18886929355 para comunicarse con una línea de ayuda gratuita y confidencial para los residentes de Nueva York Antecedentes de violencia en la ciudad de Nueva York El índice de homicidios en la ciudad de Nueva York se redujo Hay mucha menos violencia que la que solía haber en la ciudad de Nueva York Para analizar la violencia las personas por lo general observan los índices de homicidio En los últimos años el índice de homicidios de la ciudad de Nueva York los episodios de violencia más extremos ha estado por debajo de 5 por cada 100000 personas de un máximo de más de 25 por cada 100000 personas desde 1986 hasta 1990 pero la reducción en el índice de homicidios no cuenta toda la historia En esta tabla observamos tres tipos de consecuencias violentas y cómo los niveles de violencia varían en la ciudad visitas a la sala de emergencias por agresiones no mortales hospitalizaciones por agresiones no mortales y homicidios Estos datos muestran una mayor carga de violencia Cuando se desglosan según la geografía los datos muestran que algunos vecindarios tienen índices de violencia mucho más altos que otros Los vecindarios con mayor violencia tienen índices de hospitalización por agresiones no mortales que son 10 veces más altos que los vecindarios con los índices más bajos y 4 veces más altos que el índice de toda la ciudad Este patrón se mantiene en los tres indicadores Además los vecindarios con índices más altos de violencia tienen poblaciones más grandes de personas negras lo que muestra que estas poblaciones asumen una carga desproporcionada de violencia Un enfoque de salud pública para abordar la violencia Los residentes de algunos vecindarios corren un riesgo mucho mayor de sufrir violencia y sus muchos efectos en la salud Para prevenir la violencia entre las personas más afectadas debemos analizar los factores que conducen a ella La violencia está arraigada en la falta de inversión y el racismo históricos La evidencia muestra que la violencia es el resultado de estructuras sociales que limitan el acceso a las necesidades básicas son estructuras impulsadas por el racismo la segregación residencial y la falta de inversión en los vecindarios En los lugares en los que persisten estas estructuras las personas están expuestas a la violencia Por ejemplo se conoce que los vecindarios negros de bajos ingresos son los más afectados Este mapa muestra las áreas de la ciudad de Nueva York que fueron Un mapa de los tiroteos recientes se alinea con las áreas considerablemente discriminadas por el redlining del Bronx Harlem y el norte y el este de Brooklyn lo que muestra con claridad cómo la violencia actual está estrechamente relacionada con las formas en que las políticas racistas están integradas en nuestra sociedad Las décadas de Como resultado de esta falta de inversión vemos una clara relación entre la pobreza y la violencia Cuando el nivel de pobreza de un vecindario aumenta las agresiones también lo hacen La falta de inversión crea entornos que atentan contra la salud En términos de salud pública decimos que la falta de inversión genera factores ambientales que hacen que sean más probables determinadas consecuencias en la salud Debido a una historia de falta de inversión los vecindarios de la ciudad de Nueva York experimentan factores ambientales muy diferentes que predicen violencia y otras consecuencias en la salud Al decir “ambiental” nos referimos a todo el contexto físico social y económico que nos rodea el entorno construido como las viviendas y los parques y el acceso a escuelas empleos oportunidades atención médica y más El hecho de que un vecindario experimente o no más violencia se puede explicar observando si su entorno tiene factores de protección que ayudan a prevenir la violencia antes de que comience o factores de riesgo que hacen que la violencia sea una consecuencia más probable ¿Qué significa esto para los vecindarios de la ciudad de Nueva York Los vecindarios de la ciudad de Nueva York experimentan estos factores de protección y de riesgo de forma muy diferentes Algunos vecindarios carecen de muchos factores de protección y en su lugar tienen muchos más factores de riesgo Analicemos cómo se da esto comparando dos vecindarios BelmontEast Tremont en el Bronx y TottenvilleGreat Kills en Staten Island La pobreza varía entre el 62 y el 415 en los vecindarios de la ciudad de Nueva York BelmontEast Tremont tiene uno de los índices de pobreza más altos de la ciudad mientras que TottenvilleGreat Kills tiene uno de los más bajos La pobreza en los vecindarios es uno de los factores ambientales que pueden predecir la violencia ya que en los vecindarios con índices de pobreza más altos también es más probable que haya índices altos de hospitalizaciones por agresiones no mortales BelmontEast Tremont también tiene un índice alto de hospitalizaciones por agresiones no mortales uno de los más altos de la ciudad 107 por cada 100000 personas TottenvilleGreat Kills sigue el mismo patrón con uno de los índices más bajos de hospitalizaciones por agresiones no mortales solo 15 por cada 100000 personas Otra forma de comparar los índices de pobreza y violencia es clasificar a los vecindarios del más alto al más bajo y comparar sus posiciones A continuación podemos ver que BelmontEast Tremont está en el rango alto de pobreza y agresiones mientras que TottenvilleGreat Kills está en el rango bajo para ambos Cuando agregamos otros factores de riesgo emerge un patrón más significativo A continuación cada línea vertical representa los rangos de los vecindarios para los factores de riesgo de pobreza total pobreza infantil desamparo infantil educación secundaria incompleta juventud desconectada desempleo desalojos y ejecuciones hipotecarias y las consecuencias violentas de hospitalizaciones por agresiones tiroteos y homicidios Cada línea conecta a un vecindario a través de sus rangos mientras más plana sea la línea más consistentes serán los rangos Estos factores de riesgo describen una red de BelmontEast Tremont tiene un rango alto en estos factores de riesgo que hacen que la violencia sea más probable En comparación TottenvilleGreat Kills tiene un rango bajo en estos factores nbspAcerca de los datos Emerge un patrón los vecindarios con los índices de pobreza más altos que tienen un rango sistemático alto en los factores de riesgo experimentan más violencia Los vecindarios con los índices de pobreza más bajos que tienen un rango sistemático bajo en los factores de riesgo experimentan menos violencia ¿Por qué ocurre esto Estos factores de riesgo conforman una red de amenazas ambientales en comunidades que han sufrido falta de inversión Debido a la distribución desigual de recursos y oportunidades algunos vecindarios enfrentan una cantidad desproporcionada de riesgos Estas amenazas llevan a los residentes a la pobreza y los exponen a riesgos durante todas sus vidas lo que culmina en índices más altos de violencia En los entornos donde los factores de riesgo superan ampliamente los factores de protección emergen índices más altos de violencia en los vecindarios que amenazan la salud de sus residentes nbspAcerca de los datos Romper el círculo de violencia Abordar los factores que conducen a la violencia El Departamento de Salud Health Department adopta un enfoque de salud pública con respecto a la violencia Esto significa fomentar condiciones que previenen la violencia y abordar las consecuencias generadas por la violencia Significa trabajar en todos los sistemas y las comunidades para volver a invertir en los vecindarios más afectados por la violencia Este trabajo incluye lo siguiente Investigar sobre las políticas más eficaces para reducir la violencia mediante la recolección y el análisis de datos que se pueden usar para desarrollar nuevas intervenciones A través del Sistema de Gestión de Crisishttpswww1nycgovsitepeacenycinterventionscrisismanagementpagetrabajando con otras organizaciones de la ciudad para apoyar los esfuerzos comunitarios para reducir la violencia y ofreciendo apoyo a jóvenes en riesgo mediante oportunidades laborales legales terapéuticas y educativas Fortalecer los Centros de Acción Sanitaria de los Vecindarios en South Bronx Harlem y Central

        "content": "Using public health to prevent violence Experiencing violence affects people in many ways It not only causes physical injury or death but being exposed to it can also cause emotional and psychological trauma Violence doesn’t just affect the immediate victim it affects their surrounding community too Violence can affect people throughout their lives it is associated with worse birth outcomes childhood developmental delays physical and mental illness and premature deaths Violence is an epidemic and with any epidemic prevention is key And like any health issue that leads to disability disease and death there is a role for public health and healthcare to play in preventing it A common understanding of violence can help promote public health approaches to violence prevention and shift the focus from violence as a criminal behavior to instead viewing the experience of violence as a public health issue Yes violence is a behavior that some people do – but we’re focused on how people experience violence the social and environmental contexts that predict whether they do what happens as a result and how we can protect them We can use data and research to understand what leads to violence to advocate for and help implement strategies to reduce people’s exposure to violence to keep them safe and prevent lifelong harm to their health nbspAre you or is

on violence in New York City NYCs homicide rate has declined There is a lot less violence than there used to be in NYC To look at violence people often look at homicide rates In recent years NYC’s rate of homicides the most extreme episodes of violence has been under 5 per 100000 people down from a high of over 25 per 100000 people from 19861990 but a drop in the homicide rate doesnt tell the whole story In this chart we look at three types of violent outcomes and how violence levels differ across the city nonfatal assault emergency department visits nonfatal assault hospitalizations and homicides These data show a larger burden of violence When broken down by geography the data show that some neighborhoods experience violence at much higher rates than others Neighborhoods experiencing the most violence have nonfatal assault hospitalization rates that are 10 times higher than neighborhoods experiencing the lowest rates – and 4 times higher than the citywide rate This pattern is consistent across the three indicators And neighborhoods that experience higher rates of violence have larger populations of people of color showing that these populations shoulder a disproportionate burden of violence A public health approach to addressing violence Residents of some neighborhoods are at much greater risk of experiencing violence and its many health effects To prevent violence among those most affected by it we need to explore what factors lead to it Violence is rooted in historical disinvestment and racism Evidence shows that violence results from social structures that limit access to basic needs structures that are fueled by racism residential segregation and neighborhood disinvestment Where these structures persist people are exposed to violence For example lowincome neighborhoods of color are known to be hit the hardest This map shows the parts of NYC that were A map of recent shootings lines up with the heavily redlined areas of the Bronx Harlem and northern and eastern Brooklyn showing clearly how todays violence is closely related to the ways that racist policies are embedded in our society Decades of government and societal As a result of this disinvestment we see a clear relationship between poverty and violence As a neighborhoods poverty level increases so do assaults Disinvestment creates environments that threaten health In terms of public health we say that disinvestment produces environmental factors that make certain health outcomes more likely Due to a history of disinvestment New York City neighborhoods experience very different environmental factors that predict violence and other health outcomes By “environmental” we mean the entire physical social and economic context around us the built environment like housing and parks and access to schools jobs opportunity healthcare and more Whether or not a neighborhood experiences more violence can be explained by looking at whether its environment has protective factors which help prevent violence before it starts or risk factors which make violence a more likely outcome What does this mean for NYCs neighborhoods NYCs neighborhoods experience these protective and risk factors very differently Some neighborhoods have a lot less of the protective factors – and a lot more of the risk factors Lets explore how by comparing two neighborhoods BelmontEast Tremont in the Bronx and TottenvilleGreat Kills in Staten Island Poverty ranges from 62 to 415 among NYC neighborhoods BelmontEast Tremont has one of the highest poverty rates in the city while TottenvilleGreat Kills has one of the lowest Neighborhood poverty is one of the environmental factors that can predict violence with neighborhoods with higher rates of poverty more likely to also have high rates of nonfatal assault hospitalizations BelmontEast Tremont also has a high rate of nonfatal assault hospitalizations one of the highest in the city 107 per 100000 people TottenvilleGreat Kills follows the same pattern with one of the lowest rates of nonfatal assault hospitalizations only 15 per 100000 people Another way to compare poverty and violence rates is to rank neighborhoods from highest to lowest for each and compare their positions Below we can see that BelmontEast Tremont ranks high in both poverty and assaults while TottenvilleGreat Kills ranks low for both When we add in other risk factors an even more significant pattern emerges Below each vertical line represents the neighborhood rankings for the risk factors of total poverty child poverty child homelessness high school incompletion disconnected youth unemployment evictions foreclosures – and the violent outcome of assault hospitalizations shootings and homicides Each line connects one neighborhood through its ranks – the flatter the line the more consistent the ranks These risk factors describe a network of threatening BelmontEast Tremont ranks highly for these risk factors that make violence more likely By comparison TottenvilleGreat Kills ranks low for these factors nbspAbout the data A pattern emerges neighborhoods with the highest poverty rates consistently rank high for risk factors experience more violence Neighborhoods with the lowest poverty rates consistently rank low for risk factors experience less violence Why does this happen These risk factors make up a network of environmental threats in communities that have experienced disinvestment Due to the inequitable distribution of resources and opportunities some neighborhoods face a disproportionate amount of risk These threats place residents in poverty and expose them to risks throughout their lives – culminating in higher rates of violence In environments where risk factors far outweigh protective factors higher rates of neighborhood violence emerge and threaten the health of residents of these neighborhoods nbspAbout the data Breaking the cycle of violence Addressing factors that lead to violence The Health Department takes a public health approach to violence This means promoting conditions that prevent violence and addressing outcomes triggered by violence It means working across systems and communities to reinvest in neighborhoods most affected by violence This work includes Research on the most effective policies to reduce violence collecting and analyzing data that can be used to develop new interventions Through the Crisis Management Systemhttpswww1nycgovsitepeacenycinterventionscrisismanagementpage working with other city organizations to support communityled efforts to deescalate violence providing support to atrisk youth with employment legal therapeutic and educational opportunities Strengthening the Neighborhood Health Action Centers in the South Bronx Harlem and Central Brooklyn neighborhoods that all experience higher levels of violence The Action Centers serve as community hubs for programs and resources that can decrease risk and increase protective factors Working with hospitals to help them respond to the many needs – physical social and emotional – of people injured by violence Partnering with communities to respond to neighborhoodlevel mental health crises and traumatic events through Rapid Assessment and Response With this work the Health Department is reinvesting in communities that have experienced disinvestment so that we can build environments where protective factors outweigh risk factors to reduce rates of violence Public health is about assuring the conditions in which people can be healthy A public health approach to violence prevention relies on a response from all sectors of society to address the inequities that lead to violence It relies on creating and supporting systems so that both institutions and neighborhoods support the health of their residents A public health approach to violence presents an opportunity to find sustainable solutions to create healthy spaces for New Yorkers to live and thrive It means that we can prevent violence by eliminating poverty providing jobs healthy housing and education creating a society based on justice and equality that offers opportunity to all nbspAre you or is somebody you know affected by violence Help is available and you dont have to go through it alone Call 1888NYCWELL 18886929355 for a free confidential help line

warm season months of May September Of the 370 deaths From 20112020 there was an average of 10 heatstress deaths caused directly by heat From 20112019 there was an average of about 360 heatexacerbated deaths caused indirectly by heat aggravating an underlying illness Black New Yorkers are more likely to die from heat stress with death rates two times higher than among White New Yorkers This inequity is due to past and current structural racism that creates economic health care housing energy and other systems that benefit white people and disadvantage people of color Lack of access to home air conditioning AC is an important risk factor for heatstress death Among those who died from heat stress the place of death was most often an unairconditioned home NYC summers are getting hotter More warm season days now reach hotter temperatures 90°F and higher compared to a few decades ago Emergency response to extreme heat must be coupled with equitable investments in structural interventions and heat mitigation measures for example energy efficient home cooling that New Yorkers can afford to run and tree planting and greening to protect residents throughout the increasingly hot warm season weather Introduction Hot weather is dangerous to health sometimes resulting in death Heatrelated deaths are preventable In this second annual report on heatrelated mortality the Health Department examined data from 20112021 We track heatrelated deaths in three ways Heat stress deaths are caused directly by heat and happen when heatrelated illnesses such as heat exhaustion and hyperthermia lead to death These deaths are coded as heatrelated in death certificates and cases can be counted and investigated Heatexacerbated deaths happen when heat worsens existing chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes These deaths are caused indirectly by heat These deaths are caused indirectly by heat and are estimated using statistical models Neighborhood impacts are tracked by looking at communitylevel differences in risk of heatrelated death and are described using the Health Department’s Heat Vulnerability Index HVI Data for HVI inputs remain the same as last year’s report because updated data were not available This report’s findings are similar to last year’s report Heat Stress Deaths The Health Department examined heatstress deaths occurring during the warm season months of May through September from 20102020 We reviewed death certificates and medical examiner investigation reports in cases where heat was recognized as a cause of death A more detailed description of methods and data sources can be found here Among NYC residents there were 96 heatstress deaths over the 10year period There was an average of 10 deaths per year with the largest yearly numbers of deaths occurring earlier in the period as a result of severe heat waves Most deaths occurred in July 75 and August 13 followed by June 8 May 2 and September 2 As of March 2022 there were 4 heatstress deaths in 2021 though that number is provisional and subject to change because mortality records are not finalized Figure 1 Heatstress deaths and maximum heat index by year NYC residents 20112020 Notes The number of heatstress deaths for 2020 is provisional If additional deaths are certified as caused by heat stress the Department will update the number in future reports Weather data is from the National Weather Service LaGuardia airport station Heat index is a measure of air temperature and humidity Demographics The ageadjusted death rate among nonHispanic Black New Yorkers is twice as high as that of nonHispanic White New Yorkers 22 deaths per million versus 09 deaths per million from 20112020 This inequity is rooted in systemic racism1 Lack of equitable access to resources needed for wellness – for example jobs that pay a living wage affordable and healthy housing with air conditioning and health care – are causes of these differences in heatrelated mortality Death rates were higher in neighborhoods with more residents living below the federal poverty line compared with wealthier neighborhoods Ageadjusted death rates were highest in Brooklyn and the Bronx Heatstress deaths occurred among all age groups with the lowest rates among people who were 2029 and the highest among people who were 80 and older About two thirds of heat stressdeaths occurred among men Ageadjusted heatstress deaths by race and ethnicity 20112020 Deaths are grouped into these five race and ethnicity categories due to the small sample size of deaths and the availability of denominator data However these categories represent an oversimplification of the ethnically and racially diverse population found in NYC People identified as two or more races or racesethnicities not listed here are included in the other or unknown category and the HispanicLatino category includes people of any race Differences in mortality rates among racial and ethnic groups are due to longterm structural racism not biological or personal traits Structural racism — centuries of racist policies and discriminatory practices across institutions including government agencies

access differs across race and class Black New Yorkers and lowincome New Yorkers are less likely to own or use an AC during hot weather and the main reason is cost 3httpsnyccascityofnewyorkusnyccas2022report1References While more than 90 of NYC households currently have air conditioning access can be as low as 76 in neighborhoods where more people are living with limited financial resources Heat Exacerbated Deaths Deaths from chronic conditions that are not recognized as heatrelated on death certificates can be estimated using statistical models There are more of these deaths than those from heat stress They are called “excess deaths” or “heatexacerbated deaths” Unlike heatstress deaths which can be individually identified and investigated excess deaths can be estimated only as aggregate counts However estimating heatexacerbated deaths – or “mortality” – better captures the true extent of how many New Yorkers are dying of the heat In the previous two annual reports we estimated heatexacerbated mortality risk and number of deaths for a 9year period eg 20112019 for the 2022 report using weather and natural cause death data for MaySeptember in NYC Starting this year we report estimated heatexacerbated deaths for the current and historical data in fiveyear rolling time windows to characterize trends The average natural death count per year was about 18000 for May through September for the most recent 5year period 20162020 We used timeseries statistical models to compare deaths on hot days with those on cooler days We estimated heatexacerbated deaths using an indicator yesno for extreme heat event days defined by the National Weather Service’s heat advisory threshold for NYC Based on the NYC Health Department’s previous analysis of heatexacerbated mortality heat advisories are for at least 2 consecutive days with 95°F or higher daily maximum heat index HI or any day with a maximum HI of 100°F or higher a range of hot daily maximum temperatures that includes both extreme heat event days and other hot days We estimated heatexacerbated deaths for days ranging from the median maximum daily temperature of 82°F through the highest temperature during the period These models were run in 5year rolling time windows between 1971 and 2020 We included deaths occurring on the date of exposure to hot weather and over the following 3 days because previous NYC Health Department studies have shown that heatexacerbated deaths can occur up to 3 days after the initial hot weather 4 Detailed methods used to estimate risks and attributable deaths can be found in the Appendix Methods and Supplemental Data To describe the impact of climate change we examined how the number of hot days during warm months changed over the past five decades 19712020 in rolling 5year time windows We also computed the average of daily maximum temperature for each month between May and September to examine if changes in temperature varied by month nbsp Historically the estimated impacts of heat both extreme and nonextreme hot days declined substantially between 1971 and 2000 plateaued after 2000 and then started increasing in the past decade see Figure 3 From 2016 to 2020 the most recent 5year time window the estimated annual average of heatexacerbated deaths from MaySeptember for all hot days was 345 95 Confidence Interval 95CI 139 549 Heatexacerbated deaths make up approximately 2 of all naturalcause deaths in the warm months in this most recent period Heatexacerbated deaths at and above 82°F show an upward trend in the past decade see Figure 3 The estimated annual average of heatexacerbated deaths associated with extreme heat events for 20162020 was 115 95 CI 50 177 In contrast to the trend for both extreme and nonextreme hot days heatexacerbated deaths due to only extreme heat days are relatively constant over the past decade see Figure 3 Heatexacerbated mortality risks were observed across the full range of hot days maximum temperature at or above 82°F during warm season months Risk increased with temperature with the largest increases occurring at the highest temperatures and a steeper slope of relative risk above 90°F see Figure 4 Heatattributable deaths occurred most frequently in July 37 followed by August 28 June 18 September 10 and May 7 for 20162020 functionuse

single days of 95°F compared to extreme heat event days These days are also associated with increased risk of heatrelated death Figure 4 Due to climate change the numbers of extreme heat events and nonextreme hot days are increasing which contributes to an increase in heatexacerbated deaths The average number of nonextreme hot days increased from 52 in 19711975 to 74 days in 20162020 whereas the number of extreme heat days only increased from 4 in 19711975 to 11 in 20162020See Figure 5 Based on the results presented in Figures 3 and 5 the increasing number of nonextreme hot days in the past decade accounts for the increase in overall heatexacerbated deaths in the past decade The average daily maximum temperature in July—the month with the highest heathealth risk—increased 5°F from 83°F in 19711975 to 88°F in 20162020 The average daily maximum temperature in other months also increased by 3 to 5°F see Figure 6 Given the consistently high and increasing proportion of hot days in July and August heatrisk mitigation planning needs to emphasize nonemergency interventions such as access to air conditioning According to US Census Bureau’s American Housing Surveyhttpswwwcensusgovprogramssurveysahshtml and Housing and Vacancy Surveyhttpswwwcensusgovprogramssurveysnychvshtml conducted in New York City air conditioning AC prevalence increased from about 40 in 1970 to over 80 by mid2000 Figure 7 likely explaining the reduction in estimated heatexacerbated deaths in the corresponding period Figure 3 However the rate of increase in AC prevalence appears to have slowed since mid2000 Figure 7 as the number of hot days continued to increase highlighting the urgency of achieving equitable cooling in the very near future Figure 5 Average number of extreme

shows differences in heatexacerbated mortality risk The number of heat stress deaths by NTA map 2 should be interpreted with caution The NTAs are small and the number of deaths at this level is also small and unreliable so it is difficult to tell whether differences between areas are due to random fluctuation or because there is a difference in risk functionuse

New Yorkers on average each year during the warm season of May through September July accounts for the greatest share of heatexacerbated deaths and the average daily maximum temperature in July has increased by about 5°F in the past five decades Deaths have been increasing over the past decade likely due to both increasing temperatures and lagging access to home AC particularly in communities most burdened by heathealth impacts To prepare for a hotter future and prevent heatrelated deaths the City needs longlasting structural interventions alongside emergency preparedness and response Adapting to a hotter climate means the City must Ensure equitable access to lifesaving residential cooling for all New Yorkers Implement maximum temperature regulations during the summer months for tenants as laid out in 2023 PlaNYC Getting Sustainability Donehttpsclimatecityofnewyorkusinitiativesplanycgettingsustainabilitydone Explore mandates on property owners to provide tenants with AC without additional surcharges Help eligible residents apply for a free air conditioner with installation through the Home Energy Assistance Program HEAP’s Cooling Assistance Componenthttpsotdanygovprogramsheapcoolingassistance Make summertime utility costs affordable for low and middleincome New Yorkers so they can use AC to protect themselves from the heat Expand HEAP Cooling Assistance Component benefits to include summer utility costsnbsp Prohibit electricity disconnections during hot weather even if bills are unpaid Make energy prices affordable for all New Yorkers through affordable energy rates for low and middleincome customersnbsp Fund energy efficient home improvements to help reduce family energy costs and decrease pressure on the electrical grid Protect the electrical grid including by discouraging excess cooling in offices and commercial establishments Invest in hyperlocal resiliency to make all NYC neighborhoods cooler and safer Implementing green infrastructure projects especially in high HVI neighborhoods including planting trees and other greenery and expanding cool roofsnbsp Support communitybased organizations CBO working to reduce the health impacts of climate change Include CBOs and residents in decisionmaking about and investments in community infrastructure and public space Fund and provide technical assistance for programs — such as the NYC Health Department’s Be a Buddy — that support CBOs to build community resilience through social cohesion and access to physical and mental health resources that can help people stay safe in the heatnbsp Continue to strengthen emergency response during extreme heat such as opening cooling centers and issuing heathealth warnings prioritizing people and communities with the greatest need More data and information about heat climate and health is available on the NYC Health Department’snbspClimate and Health page Learn more about what the City is

heatstress data for 2021 and 2022 are considered preliminary because death data are still being compiled by the Bureau of Vital Statistics These numbers may be updated in future reports as final data become available 2021 heatstress numbers are less likely to change All heatstress tables are based on heatstress deaths from 20122021 The heatexacerbated mortality analysis requires complete daily

Ozone is a common air pollutant that can harm breathing and worsen asthma and other respiratory conditions. ED visits due to heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke and heat exhaustion, represent part of the public health burden of extreme heat. Areas in evacuation zones are at increased risk of flooding during coastal storms. They may be ordered to evacuate in the event of a hurricane or coastal flooding. Surface temperatures vary based on vegetative cover (which promotes cooling), as well as by materials that retain heat (like paved roads, sidewalks, and buildings). Hotter neighborhoods tend to have more heat-exacerbated deaths associated with extreme heat events. Neighborhood poverty measures residents' access to economic stability, education, adequate health care, safe housing and freedom from stress. Neighborhoods with higher poverty tend to have less access to these factors and experience worse health outcomes. Vegetative cover is the land covered by trees, grass, or other plants instead of a hard surface like roads, sidewalks, or buildings. Vegetative cover tends to reduce temperatures in the immediate area and may increase air quality. Mental health conditions like series psychological distress can be worsened by extreme weather such as heat waves and coastal storms. People with disabilities or access or functional needs may need additional support during extreme weather. For example, they may need extra planning for safe travel out of evacuation zones during a hurricane, or back-up electricity to support medical equipment during power outages. Information provided here about adults with independent living difficulties can help emergency management professionals better prepare our residents for emergencies. Older adults are more vulnerable to extreme weather. Those living alone may have more difficulty getting resources they need in an emergency, and are at higher risk of weather-related illnesses like heat stroke and hypothermia. Older adults (over 65) are more vulnerable to hot weather and heat stress. Air conditioning reduces the risk of heat stroke and other heat-related illness.

Nitrogen dioxide is a pollutant formed by combusion that damage lung tissue, cause breathing problems, and contribute to smog and acid rain. Ozone is a common air pollutant that can harm breathing and worsen asthma and other respiratory conditions. Estimating deaths that can be linked to PM2.5 is a way to understand how air pollution increases mortality. Boilers are a common source of SO2, which can worsen lung disease. Boilers are a common source of PM2.5, which can harm health. Boilers are a common source of NOx emissions, which can harm health. Traffic density is a measure of the average number of vehicles that occupy specified area. Traffic density can influence health as a source of air pollution and traffic-related injuries. Benzene is an air pollutant resulting from motor vehicle and industrial emissions and tobacco smoke. Benzene is a known carcinogen that can also harm bone marrow and red blood cell function. Formaldehyde is an air pollutant resulting from car exhaust and the manufacture of industrial products. Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen that can also cause irritation to eyes and lungs and increase risk of asthma and trigger asthma symptoms. PM2.5 can cause asthma ED visits, which represent part of the health burden of fine particle air pollution. Estimating hospitalizations that can be linked to PM2.5 is a way to understand how air pollution impacts public health. PM2.5 can cause cardiovascular hospitalizations, which represent part of the health burden of fine particle air pollution.

Babesiosis can also be transmitted through transfused blood products.",
