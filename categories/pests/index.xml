      <title>Real-time asthma emergency department visits</title>
      <link>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/key-topics/climatehealth/asthma-syndrome/</link>

      <guid>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/key-topics/climatehealth/asthma-syndrome/</guid>
      <description>Asthma is a common disease that makes breathing difficult, causing coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.&#xA;Things in our environment can trigger asthma or make symptoms worse - like air pollution (like fine particulates, ozone, or diesel exhaust); unhealthy housing conditions (dust mites, cockroaches, mold); or things like pollen, pets, or tobacco smoke.&#xA;Asthma is a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and missed school days. Emergency department visits for asthma are concentrated in higher-poverty neighborhoods, as poor housing quality and less access to preventive health care create barriers to managing asthma.</description>

      <description>Asthma is a common disease in which the lungs become swollen, making breathing difficult. Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and tightness in the chest. The exact causes of asthma are not known. Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be controlled.&#xA;Asthma is a leading cause of emergency room visits, hospitalizations and missed school days in New York City&amp;rsquo;s poorest neighborhoods. In NYC, asthma is more common among low-income Black and Latino children.</description>

      <title>Bed bugs</title>
      <link>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/bed-bugs/</link>

      <description>Bed bugs are small insects that feed mainly on human blood. They are often confused with other insects, and many people are not even aware of their presence until they have been bitten. However, not everyone has a reaction to bed bug bites. You may not discover that you have bed bugs until you see other signs of the pests such as, bed bugs themselves, their eggs or droppings, or the blood stains they leave behind in mattresses, box springs, chairs or other materials.</description>

      <title>Cockroaches</title>
      <link>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/cockroaches/</link>

      <description>Cockroaches are a common urban pest. Though there are more than a thousand species of roaches, just a few are found in NYC homes. The most common are American Cockroaches, typically found in moist basements and lower floors, and German Cockroaches, found anywhere inside homes.&#xA;Cockroaches like warm, dark places such as toasters, clocks, microwave ovens, walls, and cabinets. They need regular access to food and water to live and breed.</description>

      <title>Mice and rats</title>
      <link>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/mice-and-rats/</link>

      <guid>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/mice-and-rats/</guid>
      <description>Rats and mice are common, but preventable. In NYC, rats tend to be seen on streets and sidewalks, and in backyards and basements, while mice are almost always found inside homes.&#xA;Rats and mice thrive where there are sources of food and shelter and where property owners fail to prevent and adequately respond to their presence.&#xA;This site provides survey data on the prevalence of mice or rats inside and outside of buildings.</description>

      <title>Pesticides</title>
      <link>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/pesticides/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 18:02:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/pesticides/</guid>
      <description>Pesticides are chemicals applied to kill or control insects, rats and mice, undesirable plants and weeds, or fungi (e.g., mold). Pesticides are often categorized by type of use (e.g., rodenticide, insecticide) or chemical class (e.g., organophosphate, pyrethroid).&#xA;Modern pesticides have been developed to have less persistence in the environment than earlier chlorine-based chemicals such as DDT. Pesticides may be applied by a commercial applicator or a non-professional who has purchased a product from a store.</description>

      <title>Vector-borne disease</title>
      <link>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/vector-borne-disease/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 18:02:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/data-explorer/vector-borne-disease/</guid>
      <description>Vectorborne diseases are diseases that are transmitted from an arthropod (usually a tick or mosquito, etc.) to humans or other animals. Some vectorborne disease agents are maintained primarily through transmission between arthropods and humans (e.g., dengue virus and malaria), while others are maintained between arthropods and animal reservoirs (e.g., Lyme disease and West Nile virus) and humans may become infected incidentally.&#xA;Vectorborne Disease and the Environment Climate is one of many important interacting variables that affect people’s risk for vectorborne diseases in New York City.</description>

      <title>Pests and pesticides</title>
      <link>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/key-topics/pests/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2021 07:59:02 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>https://gcappbesp307.health.dohmh.nycnet/dev-stage/key-topics/pests/</guid>
      <description>Pests and pesticides can both have health effects. Household pests like mice, rats, and cockroaches can trigger asthma, while bed bugs are a well-known nuisance. Meanwhile, warmer winters may mean more vector-borne diseases like babesiosis and west nile virus.&#xA;Pesticides are chemicals used to control or kill insects, rats, mice, plants and weeds, or fungi (mold). Exposure to pesticides can occur from consuming foods or beverages that contain pesticide residues, from direct contact with the skin or eyes, or from breathing air in areas where pesticides are applied.</description>
