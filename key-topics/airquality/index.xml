      <description>NYCCAS Report: 2008-2021 In 2007, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Health Department) established the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS), the largest ongoing urban air monitoring program of any U.S. city. NYCCAS, which began collecting data in December 2008, is a collaboration between the Health Department and Queens College of the City University of New York and provides data to:
Help inform PlaNYC, the City’s sustainability plan Track changes in air quality over time Estimate exposures for health research Inform the public about local topics, such as recent air quality improvements, car-free zones, changes in the sources of air pollution, unique air quality studies conducted in New York City, efforts to reduce health impacts and differences in air quality and related health impacts across NYC neighborhoods.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Air Quality</title>

      <description>NYC&amp;rsquo;s air quality is generally good and has been improving over time. But hour to hour, there&amp;rsquo;s large variation in our air quality - even in neighborhoods with the cleanest air. That means that for short periods, some New Yorkers are exposed to high levels of pollutants.
Fine particles (PM2.5) are among the most harmful pollutants. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 contributes to an estimated 2,300 excess deaths from lung and heart disease each year in NYC (1 out of every 20 deaths in NYC), and short-term exposure contributes to asthma incidents severe enough to require a trip to the emergency department, as well as other health threats.</description>

      <title>Your Neighborhood&#39;s Air Quality</title>

      <description>We combine data from our air quality monitoring network, NYCCAS, with other data to understand what makes one neighborhood&amp;rsquo;s air quality different from another&amp;rsquo;s. We found that building emissions, building density, industrial areas, and traffic density are associated with differences in air quality.
If we don&amp;rsquo;t have an air quality monitor in one neighborhood, but we know its building density, its industrial area, and its traffic, then we can model (estimate or predict) its air quality - based on monitored air quality in similar neighborhoods.</description>
