      <description>Summary Each summer, on average, an estimated 350 New Yorkers die prematurely because of hot weather in New York City (NYC). These heat-related deaths account for about 2% of all deaths over the warm season months of May through September. Of the 350 deaths: From 2012-2021, there were an average of 7 heat-stress deaths (caused directly by heat). From 2016-2020, there were an average of about 345 heat-exacerbated deaths (caused indirectly by heat aggravating an underlying illness).</description>

      <description>The weather forecast is the best way to predict heat-related health outcomes.&#xA;We can also track heat-related illness with near real-time electronic data from emergency departments at hospitals throughout NYC. These data include illnesses directly attributed to heat (including heat exhaustion, muscle cramps, fainting and heat stroke), not the full burden of heat-related health impacts.</description>
