Inhabitants of area are largely N.Y.C. commuters. Many have bought here beyond their means with homes mortgaged for 90% of their selling price. Despite this fact there have been very few foreclosures up to the present. Probably the highest loan possible to obtain today in this area would be about $7000. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Are only nominally different from what they were in 1938-39 ($8500 to $10,000.) Offering are infrequent inasmuch as this section is well held by a stable class of dwellers and has consistently been regarded as one of the prime spots on Staten Island. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): Rentals have always been in excellent demand here, and available properties are at a premium. There is not a vacant house in this area today. Despite this exceptional demand, prices have not advanced which is entirely consistent with rental experience elsewhere in the borough. Construction in this area is entirely single family, and the few that are rented bring from $75 to $90 a month. General Comments: This is probably the best balanced, most uniform and typically \"A\" area on Staten Island. It is not handicapped by the presence of large homes of the estate class as are some of the hill sections in the saem grade. It is, therefore, better lending territory, and in fact institutions compete for loans here. Surroundings and layout are good and there are no adverse influences present. One new home is under construction, in the southeastern portion but aside from this there has been no new construction during the past year, and the area may be said to be leveling off.

Here are a few very large and expensive estates. Tax valuations were established before the Staten Island land boom of 1923-26 and are accordingly low. A superb location as to scenic advantages. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Recent erection of a large new apartment building on the south side of Victory Boulevard, facing Silver Lake Reservoir has had the effect of stiffening prices somewhat in the immediate vicinity as several old homes stand on potential sites for apartment construction. These sites are all on Victory Blvd., the north boundary of the area, facing Silver Lake Park, Southeast of this boundary the terrain rises sharply, and the interior of the area is built up with large expensive homes. Prices on these have declined somewhat, although the decline is nominal and not supported by any sales. Institutions made few loans in here and have taken very few properties through foreclosure. No demand and no activity. About the minimum price, even in today's market, would be $20,000. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): About $20 a room in the new 65 apartment building on Victory Boulevard facing the Park. This building is nearly filled. Other available rentals are all large single houses which bring from $75 to $100 a month. There are few vacancies in this area which is noteworthy for splendid scenic advantages and convenience to trans-bay transportation. General Comments: New apartment building above mentioned is only new construction. Owners are understood to contemplate further construction of this character and the area is admirably suited therefore. Land valuations here are somewhat lower than elsewhere, which is a further circumstance favoring multi-family construction.","6":" A 2 Grymos Hill, Staton Island","31":"100","32":"","33":"","1a":"Crest pf hill, sloping steeply downward to northwest within the area, and bordered by still steeper slopes downward to east of the area.
