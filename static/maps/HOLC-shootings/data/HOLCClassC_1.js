Considerable revamping has taken place in last twenty years, quite a few modern apartment houses and substantial remodeling of old single homes into small apartments and rooming houses. Much of the area may continue a slow improvement. Certain of the streets in the area are much better than others. 12th St. between 6th & 7th Ave. still has some old private residences which are well kept up. Bank St. and West 10th and portions of others have witnessed remodeling on a good scale of old private residences into chiefly two and three room apartments. These converted dwellings may house from 3 to 10 families and command rentals up to $20 per room per month. This district had its geratest activity of recent years during the Prohibition Era. Many of its old or converted houses were partially occupied as speakeasies and commanded very high rents from such sources. Rents in the '20's whether for small apartments or furnished rooms were very high, probably on the average of more than twice the present levels. The poorer streets of the area are those where neither high grade remodeling has been done nor modern apartments erected and still represent very poor neighborhoods chiefly of cheap tenements renting for around $6-7 or $8 per room per month. Present price range (present market very limited) of private dwellings is primarily for conversion puposes and may be quoted on the better streets as about $12,000-20,000 as contrasted with former highs in the neighborhood of $20-40M. General upward trend. 4th St. is static. Wide range in sales and rental prices due to similar range in quality of various neighborhoods in the area.

","5":"Principal highway: Westervelt Ave. Construction expensive due to steep slopes. Tax valuation on land very high- justified for apartment house purposes but too high for successful development of small dwellings. Northeast section of this area is of higher value than the westerly portion. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Only nominally lower than 1938-39 because this was an old area and prices had been hammered down pretty well by offerings of foreclosed property soon after the market crash of 1929. However most of these have been cleared out, and while prices haven't recovered to any extent, there are pretty steady due to proximity to the New York ferry, the best shopping center of Staten Island and to good amusement facilities. Administration offices of the Borough are located here also. Today's prices on singles range generally from $4500 to $9000; two family structures are in little demand and prices would be $6000 to $6500. Not much activity. Trend slowly downward because of age. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): Convenience of location with respect to New York ferries makes this a good rental district for the commuter with moderate income. Rental demand has always been good here and today there are a dearth of available units. Singles bring from $50 to $80, depending on condition and location; units in two family dwelling; $45 to $60; and apartments in modern buildings rent from $70 to $125. General Comments: Best values are along Ft. Hill Circle, the highest point in the area. There are many old houses in this neighborhood for which there is no present demand except at sacrifice prices. Trend is toward apartments. Land is over valued for tax purposes which is another influence away from single family and toward multi-family construction. This is an \"island\" in the middle of a fourth grade area. No new construction is to be seen here and some additional pressure will have to come from the rental market to afford stimulus for apartment house construction which is about the only thing the area is suited for.","6":"New Brighton, Staten Island 1 C+","31":"40","32":"40","33":"20","1a":"Hilly with steep down grade to north and east.

In this area are a few very cheap poorly constructed single houses, relatively much less desirable than the worst of the 2-family units. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): For large old singles (8 to 12 rooms, 40 to 75 years old) about 10% lower than in 1939, with very little demand as it has been experienced that these cannot be remodeled at a profit. Two family structures meet with a better reception here than in some parts of the County less thickly populated with Italian families. Nevertheless, there have been no sales traceable at anywhere near the 1938-39 top figure of $12,000 and this may now be regarded as nominal only. About $8500 would be an average high price for almost anything in the area today. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): About the same as in 1938-39. Very light vacancy here, as elsewhere on Staten Island. Singles in tenantable condition bring from $35 to $50; apartments in 2 family buildings are generally $35 to $45, with very few higher. Conditions have leveled off in the rental market and no immediate change forecast. General Comments: Small cheap one story stores along Bay Street in this vicinity. The neighborhood appears to be going strongly Italian with the almost inevitable down hill trend which usually accompanies influx of this racial group. It may benefit slightly from the anticipated increase in military activity at Ft. Wadsworth but this is rather problematical, and any benefits would likely be indirect inasmuch as the area contains few houses suited for official tenancy. Trend expected to remain somewhat downward. No new construction here during the past year. The Corporation owns a total of 7 houses in the area and has sold 5 in 1940. Institutional holdings are very few. Best values are along Belair Road near the U.S. Quarantine Station. West of Bay Street, the best values are found in the south part of the area.

Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Higher priced singles have come down sharply where any sales at all are noted; the house quoted at $7000 in 1938 may be offered at $5500 today. Two family structures have suffered even more; whereas $8500 to $12,000 was mentioned as a fair bracket in 1938, today it would be more like $6000 to $8500, with no demand whatever at the second figure. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): Rents were always pretty low in here, considering property values, and therefore haven't changed noticeably within the past two years. Singles still bring from $20 to $45; apartments in two family dwellings from $40 to $45 heated. Demand is good and there appear to be very few vacancies. General Comments: HOLC has upwards of 40 houses in this area. Many were early foreclosures and have not been reappraised, consequently are priced somewhat higher than competing houses. Few offers are made on property in this area. Property management brokers operating in this area cite instances where the Corporation refused offers two months ago which they are now seeking to revive. Competitors are not selling well in here either; although they have a heavy load at present. Majority of sales are to Italians, who buy sacrifice property in wife's name. No new construction has gone in during the past year and the area is noticeably \"stagnant\", probably because of the racial factor. Institutions have made consecutive reductions of their offerings without apparently having much effect on speeding up liquidation. No future improvement forecast and the trend is downward.

","5":"Principal highway: Amboy Rd. These are 3 of the oldest villages on Staten Island. Very little change is noted here, with the old native element still in the majority. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec. 1940): A negligible sales demand and consequent lack of activity have resulted in little or no change in prices for single houses, of which the area is entirely comprised. Today's range approximates that of 1939: $3500 to $5500. A few small new cottages have been sold in here for prices ranging in $2500 class, but these are exceptional and not at all consistent with the balance of the area. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): Same as for 1938-39; sinlges renting for $30 to $45 and not much activity very little seasonal movement in this district is too rural in character. Very few vacancies observed in a tour of the area. General Comments: Some new construction in here recently: 14 small 4 to 5 room bungalows just south of Amboy Road in the small detached section of C-23. These were built by a Brooklyn concern and trouble was experienced even before completion, with the sanitation. The land is low at that point and drainage is insufficient. The condition was so bad that the Sanitary Department refused to issue certificates of occupancy for these houses. They were sold at various prices with this defect, probably $2500 being the top price, and are now all occupied. In general the area is best north of Amboy Road, though even here poor houses are scattered among the better ones. The three \"stems\" extending northward in this area are all very sparsely developed, perhaps about 20 to 30%. Much of the area was cut through with streets and sidewalks years ago in the hope of future growth which never came. This is particularly true of the eastern most \"finger\", along Hugenot Avenue, where there are only two streets with houses: Rathbun and Rensselaer (north of Edgegrove). The street surface in here is very bad on all side streets: sidewalks are partially overgrown with small trees and brush. Three new bungalows with built in garages on Ramona Avenue, a brand new dual highway which opens up some good building sites in this area. HOLC has 15 houses in the area; institutions have an estimated 50 at the most. Sales have been rarae. (None for HOLC).

","5":"Principal highways: Amboy Rd., Hyland Ave., Main St. Many foreclosures in this section. Old native element still dominating. Most of the residents were employed in factories across the river in New Jersey with the partial shut down of many of these. Stagnation is apparent in Tottenville. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Prices on properties which were quoted at $7000 in 1938-39 have dropped about 10% or more. Approaching the bottom of the range for singles, the price drop becomes progressively less, 5% being the average loss in value for the smaller houses in the $2500 class. Two family structures are at an absolute minimum of demand and few indeed are sales of this type. Prices would be arbitrary and are not even suggested, as sellers will take almost anything they can get in forced sales of this kind. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): Rents were low here in 1939 and have not regained any of the drop which followed the industrial decline in Tottenville about 1930. The village is too far removed from the New York ferry and there are no local opportunities for employment. Transportation via the Outerbridge Crossing to nearby New Jersey is expensive, and those who are employed in Jersey factories prefer to live on that side of the river (Arthur Kill). Prices today would be no different than they were two years ago, i.e. $22 to $45 for singles; $25 to $45 for two family units. General Comments: Attractions are away from Tottenville rather than to it. Some houses are standing vacant because it is difficult to find tenants because of the distance to the New York ferry, and the cost of getting there (25 cents). This was a fairly thriving town when the shipyards were operating, but with their closing in 1930 came a decline. There is very little activity here today. HOLC holds some 36 houses unsold and institutions have an estimated 75 more. As stated, sales have been very few. HOLC sold only one during 1940. Here again, great activity would probably result from the approval of the proposed Prince's Bay drydock site, which is now under consideration.

","5":"Main highway: Henderson Ave. Some of the large old houses were converted to small private schools. Small houses have not suffered so much and due to the location they can still be rented at a fair figure. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): About 5% lower than 1938-39 levels due to lack of demand for the large old fashioned single houses in this area. Today these are difficult to dispose of, even at $7000 to $7500 which is less than half of what they were quoted in pre-depression times immediately prior to 1929. Sales trend is definetely downward, in line with demand, which fades with the demise of the present owners who are principally retired folk. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): In line with the good rental demand in nearly all sections of Staten Island, this area is no exception. Prices here are fairly firm at same levels as during 1938-39: $55-$65 for larger old houses; $45 to $55 for 6 to 8 room houses. Rental demand is helped by proximity to New York ferries and by the fact that this area is in a five cent fare zone. General Comments:This area is near the U.S. Gypsum Company's plant in New Brighton, which concern has profited indirectly from defense activities in the way of building construction on Staten Island and elsewhere in the New York area. However, no great increase in employment has resulted, and some of those who have been hired come from other boroughs as commuters. The same may be said of shipyard increases. Many of the new employees have been recruited from outside the borough and it is a commonly heard complaint that the Staten Island men \"can'tevengetinsidethegates\". There are various explanations of this. One is that shipyard work has been at a low ebb here for such a long while that those who were laid off long ago have passed the age where they are regarded as desirables, and are being passed over in favor of younger men from outside. The McWilliams shipyard, within a mile of this area has just been acquired by the National Youth Administration which has announced its intention to use the yard as a training center for those between the ages of 18 and 23 in ship work. About 1400 are to be thus engaged, principally local residents. It is not expected that this will have much effect on the area except insofar as rentable rooms are concerned.

This small \"pocket\" enclosed by parks and a main thoroughfare has no chance for expansion, and being an area of comparatively few foreclosures, has seen little or no activity in recent years.  Excellent recreational facilities, and protection against encroachment afforded by the above mentioned parks has served to steady the area and to head off what would otherwise almost certainly be a strong downward pitch.  Singles nominally priced at $4500 to $5000, with more near the former figure. (\/n) Rental prices Dec 1940: Same as 1938-39 and demand is good because of convenient and cheap transportation, and proximity of shopping center and amusements facilities.  $40 to $50 for singles; more are rented at the lower figure.
