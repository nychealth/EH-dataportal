Few 1 fam. houses remaining and most of these converted to rooming house usage. Demand for rooming houses declining, since recent enforcement of Tenement House Dept. requirements which demand that collar, ceilings and public halls be fire-retarded. In 1929 some private homes could have been sold for as high as $100,000. This represwented fictitious prices and was far above value. Trend today is entirely to multi-family. Rents for private homes or rooming houses changed but little since 1929. No demand for such rentals in those times. Such rents were also indicative of excessive and fictitious selling prices.","6":"Carl Schurz Park, Manhattan B 5","31":"90","32":"10","33":"","1a":"Level - elevated and looking over the East River.

","5":"Principal thoroughfares: Clove Rd., Forest Ave., Broadway Quite a number of foreclosures in this area due to the fact that people here generally bought beyond their menas. However, the area should develop rapidly with any economic improvement, due to its favorable location. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Differ very little from 1938-9 levels. New building activity has supported a demand which has been reflected in institutional and HOLC sales. (HOLC at present owns 13, has sold 19). Title Guaranty and Trust Co. recently sold 5; Staten Isalnd Savings Bank sold 1; Staten Island National Bank and Trust Co. sold 1; Northfield Savings and Loan Assn sold 1. Details not available on thesesales but prices ranged between $5500 and $8000. Title Guaranty and Trust Company sales have generally been somewhat below market and in sections where they had large holdings the effect of their activity has been felt. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): About the same as 1938-39 with good demand up to $55. Comparatively high percentage of occupancy in this area because of its favorable location. Effects of Defense Activity: There has been considerable activity in the ship yards along the north shore of Staten Island, resulting from defense contracts. However, as yet the real estate market has derived little or no apparent benefit from the increased employment. Many workers commute from Brooklyn and from adjacent New Jersey and as yet have shown little disposition to move to nearby quarters. General Comments: About 25 to 30 new one family homes built last year. These are brick bungalows, and two story houses, principally located in the south part of the area which is high and somewhat undeveloped in a few spots. Prices range from $6500 to $7500 and FHA financing is offered. 10% cash payment required. Some homes have been built to order for owners who have purchased lots from the builder. There is room for further development in this small part and some activity may be expected. Institutions are believed to hold but little property here now.

","5":"Principal highway: Bay St. A small area developed by one of the leading real estate firms of Staten Island. \"Exclusive\". Fenced in on all sides. Bay front along the \"Narrows\" channel to N.Y. harbor. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): About 5% lower than 1938-39. At that time there was no sales in this small and somewhat exclusive area excepting a few new ones built for owners. About a year ago the Corporation sold one in here for $8000, which is regarded rather low to be a typical transaction. The predominating house in this area is of the $10,000 class, with better values near the waterfront and the cheaper houses nearer Bay Street. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): Very few rented in here and prices have not changed since 1938-39 when $90 to $100 was customary. This is essentially a tight little community of home owners of the better class for Staten Island. General Comments: With expansion of military operations in nearby Ft. Wadsworth this is a logical spot for a possible overflow of officers' families not able to secure quarters on the Reservation. The area is too small to be of great importance as there were few foreclosures here and not much property is held by institutions and none by HOLC. It is fenced in on all sides. One drawback consists in the unattractive approach along Bay Street, and also in the fact that poorer neighborhoods with low grade foreign population encircle it excepting for the waterfront and the Military Reservation to the south. Roadways are narrow and there are few sidewalks. Not in the path of future development and may be expected barely to hold its place for the next few years. Two new single family dwellings are now under construction here for owners.

Some streets shown on map leading from blue to red area have not been cut. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Only a nominal decline since 1938. Impossible to trace any actual sales here as the area has been pretty close to static for the past two years. Demand is very slow and a static condition may be predicted, due to topographical condition making construction expensive and difficult. Dwellers here have generally been a good stable class and foreclosures were comparatively few. hence no institutional offerings. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): This was never much of a rental area, single family structures being about 90% owner occupied. Apartments and two-family dwellings constituted only 0% of the structures. Prices have remained firm here and vacancy is not exceeding 5% of rental units. Singles command from $75 to $90; units in multiples from $50 to $65. General comments: Assessed valuations here are proportionally lower than almost any place on Staten Island, being about 60% of market value. This is because of the fact that valuations were established here, on land, prior to the land boom in the early twenties. The area is somewhat handicapped by proximity to very much lower class neighborhoods on the east, and further because of abnormally steep slopes, making access difficult in slippery weather.

Sewer and other public improvements present. Room for expansion. Future prosepects favorable, good road connections to all parts, bridges, ferries, etc. Zoning residential with exception of 100' depth from Forest Ave. Sale Prices (Dec.1940): Down about 5% from 1938 levels. Competition of new and cheaper homes, together with price cutting by institutions which had acquired property here accountable for reductions. This area was the scene of a speculative development resulting in some second mortgage transactions which turned out badly in some instances. An active development now going on here which is not calculated to help the market on older homes in the area. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): No perceptible change from 1938-9 levels. Offerings are few and these are readily absorbed at $50 to $65. HOLC has 7 houses in here; all rented. Trend is firm and the area will continue to be good rental territory. General Comments: Impossible to obtain data on comparative sales here. HOLC has sold only one and institutional sales have been very few within the past year. One of the most active developments on Staten Island during the past two years is in the area. About 50 small brick and frame bungalows have been built here during that period, ranging in price up to $6500. The E.J. McCormick Co. has recently completed 20 brick veneer bungalows which are offered with FHA financing, 10% down. A representative of that concern advised that about 80 more are contemplated and land is now being cleared in preparation. In addition to this group, 21 more are to be built by the A.J. Behrens Co. along College Ave. south of Crystal. These also are offered with FHA financing at prices in the $6000 class. However, later development appears slightly inferior to the types which originally went in here and the area may be expected to level off in the near future with completion of the above housing. Demand is said to be somewhat disappointing to the McCormick concern although this has not altered heir plans for the 80 houses mentioned above. Sales have been to a salaried class: firemen, policemen and salesmen traveling for large corporations. So far, none have 'come back'. While the development is not far distant from the shipyards of the north shore, it is worth comment that not an inquirt has been received from that source to date. Desirability decreases somewhat approaching the south boundary, Warchogue Road, which section is somewhat low. The area is further penalized by inadequate transportation and by being entirely surrounded by lower grade neighborhoods.
